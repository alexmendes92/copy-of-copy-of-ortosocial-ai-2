However, donor‐site morbidity remains a concern, especially with grafts harvested from key functional muscles [ 8 , 16 ].\n\nAmong autografts used for ACL reconstruction, hamstring tendons are the most commonly selected worldwide due to their favorable biomechanical properties, ease of harvest, and relatively low donor‐site morbidity. The quadriceps tendon (QT) autograft has recently gained popularity for ACL reconstruction, offering structural strength and versatility in harvesting techniques [ 3 , 13 , 30 ]. A specific technique uses only the superficial layer of the QT—the rectus femoris (RF)—which may reduce morbidity while preserving adequate graft size [ 5 ].\n\nDespite its advantages, concerns remain about postoperative quadriceps weakness due to graft harvesting from the extensor mechanism. Importantly, superficial RF harvest is biomechanically distinct from full‐thickness QT harvest, as it preserves deeper fibers of the quadriceps tendon and is therefore expected to result in less pronounced early quadriceps deficits [ 5 ]. Several studies have demonstrated that quadriceps tendon autografts—particularly when harvested as full‐thickness grafts—are associated with greater early strength deficits, resulting in more pronounced quadriceps weakness in the early postoperative period compared with hamstring or patellar tendon grafts [ 4 , 17 , 18 ]. Given that quadriceps performance is closely linked to knee function, risk of reinjury, and long‐term osteoarthritis development [ 24 ], these deficits raise clinical concerns. Focusing specifically on RF may mitigate such strength loss by preserving deeper fibers and minimizing donor‐site morbidity. This justifies further evaluation of the RF graft, particularly in comparison to the commonly used hamstring tendon [ 24 ].\n\nThe purpose of this study was to compare isokinetic quadriceps performance between patients undergoing ACL reconstruction with rectus femoris autografts and those with traditional hamstring tendon grafts. It was hypothesized that RF autografts would yield comparable performance.\n\n\n## MATERIALS AND METHODS\nThis was a cross‐sectional observational study designed to assess quadriceps performance recovery in patients approximately 6 months after undergoing anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using either an ipsilateral rectus femoris tendon or hamstring tendon autograft.\n\nThe study protocol was approved by the institutional review board (IRB protocol no. CAAE: 83875024.9.0000.5294), and all participants provided written informed consent prior to inclusion. All procedures adhered to the ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinki.\n\nPatients aged 18 years or older who had undergone primary anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) using either an ipsilateral rectus femoris tendon or a hamstring tendon autograft were eligible for inclusion. All surgeries were performed by the same orthopedic surgical team using standardized techniques. Patients were consecutively recruited between January 2023 and July 2024 during routine postoperative visits. Participants were evaluated at a single time point, approximately 6 months after surgery (between 24 and 28 weeks postoperatively (minimum required follow‐up ≥24 weeks).\n\nInclusion criteria required patients to have undergone primary ACLR, completed a standardized rehabilitation protocol, and had no prior knee surgery on either side—including contralateral ACLR. Exclusion criteria included multiligamentous injuries, concomitant meniscal or chondral procedures, signs of degenerative joint disease, revision ACLR, or graft harvest from the contralateral limb.\n\nFormal randomization was not used. To minimize selection bias, we initially aimed for a consecutive, alternating assignment of graft type (rectus femoris → hamstring → rectus femoris…), as our team is equally experienced with both techniques. This non‐concealed, quasi‐random scheme was subject to change to preserve patient safety and graft adequacy. Participants for the present analysis were recruited consecutively at routine postoperative visits between January 2023 and July 2024, and not all eligible patients consented to participate. These features may introduce allocation and recruitment bias, which we acknowledge in the Limitations.\n\nAll patients included in the study underwent primary anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction performed by the same orthopedic surgical team, using standardized arthroscopic techniques. No concomitant ligamentous, meniscal, or chondral procedures were performed, as these were part of the exclusion criteria. A pneumatic tourniquet was used on the ipsilateral proximal thigh at approximately 320 mmHg.\n\nIn the RF group, graft harvest followed a previously described technique [ 5 ]. A 3‐cm longitudinal incision was made from the superior pole of the patella at the junction of the lateral and middle thirds. After dissection, the quadriceps tendon (QT) was identified, and a 10‐mm‐wide graft was obtained from the rectus femoris (superficial lamina of QT). The dissection extended proximally for approximately 8 cm, preserving the intermediate and deep QT layers. With the knee flexed at 20°, a closed tendon stripper was used to complete the harvest. The distal free end was whipstitched with nonabsorbable sutures. Proximally, the rectus femoris lamina broadens; harvest proceeded within this laminar plane using a closed tendon stripper under direct tactile guidance, thereby preserving the intermediate and deep quadriceps tendon layers. No specialized instrumentation was required—once the correct cleavage plane between the rectus femoris and the remaining quadriceps was identified, a standard closed stripper permitted complete proximal release and retrieval of the graft at the desired width. The graft was folded, with a minimum ACL component length of 9 cm and diameter of 8 mm (mean diameter of 9 mm). The donor site was closed in layers with meticulous hemostasis, and a compressive dressing was applied to minimize the risk of hematoma formation; suction drains were not used (Figures 1 and 2 ).\n\nGraft harvest: Rectus femoris.

(b) A cleavage plane is developed approximately 3 cm proximal to the patella. A 10‐mm‐ wide graft is outlined with two parallel incisions in the superficial layer and detached distally from the patella. The free end is whipstitched with nonabsorbable sutures. (c) The dissection is extended proximally for about 8 cm using scissors, preserving the intermediate and deep layers. With the knee flexed at 20°, the graft is harvested using a closed tendon stripper.

No specialized instrumentation was required—once the correct cleavage plane between the rectus femoris and the remaining quadriceps was identified, a standard closed stripper permitted complete proximal release and retrieval of the graft at the desired width.\n\nGraft harvest: Rectus femoris. The harvested rectus femoris tendon is placed on the preparation table. Excess muscle fibers and irregularities are removed.\n\nIn the hamstring tendon (HT) group, grafts were harvested via a 2‐ to 3‐cm incision over the pes anserinus insertion. After opening the sartorius fascia, the semitendinosus and gracilis tendons were identified, dissected, and released distally. A tendon stripper was used to detach the proximal muscular insertions, and the free ends were whipstitched with nonabsorbable sutures. Final graft preparation typically yielded a 4‐strand construct with a mean diameter of 8.0–9.0 mm.\n\nACLR was performed using a standardized arthroscopic technique in both groups. A high anterolateral portal and a low anteromedial portal were created. The femoral tunnel was positioned at the native ACL footprint, located on the lateral femoral condyle posterior to the resident's ridge [ 22 ]. A 90° femoral guide was inserted through the anterolateral portal and oriented intra‐articularly at the center of the femoral footprint. Extra‐articularly, the guide was positioned through a 2‐cm longitudinal incision over the lateral femoral epicondyle, with the tunnel directed approximately 4 mm posterior and 8 mm proximal to the epicondyle, corresponding to the anatomic origin of the anterolateral ligament [ 1 , 2 ]. Importantly, no patients in this study underwent concurrent anterolateral ligament reconstruction or lateral extra‐articular tenodesis; all procedures consisted of isolated ACL reconstructions.\n\nThe tibial tunnel was positioned at the native ACL tibial footprint, aligned with the posterior edge of the anterior horn of the lateral meniscus and approximately 15–20 mm anterior to the posterior cruciate ligament [ 22 ]. A tibial guide set at 55° was introduced through the anteromedial portal, with its intra‐articular tip centered on the ACL footprint. Extra‐articularly, the guide was positioned 4 cm distal to the tibial joint line, about 1 cm above the pes anserinus insertion and 2 cm medial to the tibial tuberosity. A 2‐mm guide pin was advanced through the guide until visualized intra‐articularly.\n\nGrafts were passed from the tibial to the femoral tunnel using a shuttle suture. Femoral fixation was performed using an interference screw matching the tunnel diameter. Tibial fixation was performed with the knee at 20° of flexion using an interference screw one size larger than the tunnel diameter, ensuring secure tensioning and compression of the graft.\n\nAll patients followed a standardized, time‐based rehabilitation program supervised by the same institutional physical therapy team; the program was identical for both graft groups. Early rehabilitation (postoperative days 0–14) emphasized range‐of‐motion restoration and quadriceps activation, with weightbearing as tolerated and typical discontinuation of crutches by Week 2.\n\nFrom Weeks 4 to 6, progressive strengthening (closed‐kinetic‐chain) and neuromuscular training were advanced. Between Weeks 6 and 12, lower‐extremity strengthening and proprioceptive training were intensified, with low‐impact cardiovascular conditioning maintained throughout. Straight‐line running was typically introduced between months 4 and 5, followed by light plyometrics and change‐of‐direction drills around months 5–6.\n\nReturn to pivoting sports was allowed no earlier than 9 months postoperatively, contingent on completion of sport‐specific functional testing and clinical clearance.\n\nThe rehabilitation protocol was identical for both graft groups to minimize variability in recovery outcomes. Neither the physical therapists nor the investigators performing isokinetic testing were blinded to graft type, as the incision site made graft allocation evident.\n\nAll participants underwent a single‐day isokinetic quadriceps performance assessment conducted in the morning. Bilateral testing was performed in a fixed order: the nonoperative limb was always tested first, followed by the operative limb. Participants were instructed to abstain from alcohol, ergogenic substances, and vigorous physical activity for at least 48 h prior to the evaluation.\n\nQuadriceps performance was assessed using a computerized isokinetic dynamometer (Multi‐Joint System 4, Biodex®, USA). Measured variables included peak torque (PT), peak torque normalized to body weight (PT/BW), angle of peak torque, total work, and average power [ 9 ] (Figure 3 ).\n\nIsokinetic quadriceps performance: (a) Multi‐Joint System 4, Biodex®, USA. (b and c) Participant's isokinetic quadriceps performance during test.\n\nBefore testing, each participant completed a 10‐min self‐paced warm‐up on a stationary bicycle. Subjects were then seated in the dynamometer chair and stabilized with straps across the trunk and pelvis. The knee joint axis was aligned with the dynamometer axis using the lateral femoral condyle as a reference. The resistance arm was positioned and secured 5 cm proximal to the medial malleolus, following the manufacturer's instructions.\n\nFor the familiarization phase, participants performed three submaximal concentric contractions of knee flexion and extension at 60°/s, moving from 90° of flexion to full extension. This was followed by five maximal concentric repetitions at the same angular velocity. After a 120‐s rest, the protocol was repeated for the operative limb. Standardized verbal encouragement and real‐time visual feedback were provided throughout the testing session.\n\nSample size and power: The a priori sample size calculation was based on quadriceps peak torque (PT) as the primary endpoint. An expected standard deviation of 10% was drawn from previous isokinetic performance studies in post‐ACLR athletes [ 12 , 24 ]. Recruitment was therefore planned to achieve group sizes sufficient to detect clinically meaningful differences within this variability. However, the observed variability in the present study was larger than anticipated, and between‐group effects were small. As a result, the achieved power was insufficient to exclude small effects, and our inference relies primarily on effect sizes and 95% confidence intervals rather than formal equivalence testing.\n\nAnalyses were performed in Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 20.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). Normality and homoscedasticity were assessed with Shapiro–Wilk and Levene tests, respectively. Between‐group comparisons used independent t‐tests; within‐subject (operated vs. contralateral) comparisons used paired t‐tests. Data are reported as mean ± SD with 95% CIs. We additionally present mean differences and Cohen's d to qualify clinical relevance beyond p‐values. Statistical significance was set at p ≤ 0.05. Given the small observed between‐group effect (peak torque mean difference 5.3 Nm, 95% CI –20.4 to 30.9; d ≈ 0.10) and the larger‐than‐expected SDs, the study is underpowered for small effects; therefore, our inference emphasizes effect sizes and precision rather than equivalence.\n\n\n## Study design and ethical approval\nThis was a cross‐sectional observational study designed to assess quadriceps performance recovery in patients approximately 6 months after undergoing anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using either an ipsilateral rectus femoris tendon or a hamstring tendon autograft.\n\nThe study protocol was approved by the institutional review board (IRB protocol no.

Of these, 44 (58.6%) underwent ACL reconstruction using a hamstring tendon (HT) autograft, and 31 (41.4%) received an autograft from the rectus femoris (RF) tendon. All participants were male, with a mean age of 25.6 ± 4.3 years (RF group: 26.1 ± 4.5 years; HT group: 25.3 ± 4.2 years). The majority sustained their injury while practicing pivoting sports (mainly soccer and futsal), and all reported regular preinjury participation in recreational or competitive sports. Although the sample was expanded to increase diversity, no female patients meeting the inclusion criteria presented during the recruitment period, and no sex‐based exclusion criteria were applied.\n\nNo statistically significant differences were observed between the RF and HT groups in any of the isokinetic knee extensor performance variables. Mean peak torque (PT) was 173.0 ± 62.0 Nm in the RF group and 167.7 ± 45.7 Nm in the HT group (mean difference 5.3 Nm, 95% CI –20.4 to 30.9; p = 0.689). Peak torque normalized to body weight (PT/BW) was 217.5 ± 81.4% in the RF group and 209.7 ± 65.8% in the HT group (mean difference 7.8%, 95% CI –26.8 to 42.4; p = 0.661). Angle at peak torque (aPT) was 62.2 ± 9.7° in the RF group and 59.9 ± 8.2° in the HT group (mean difference 2.3°, 95% CI –1.9 to 6.5; p = 0.280). Total work (TW) was 820.8 ± 294.0 J versus 809.4 ± 239.2 J (mean difference 11.4 J, 95% CI –113.9 to 136.8; p = 0.859). Mean power (PM) was 118.1 ± 44.0 W versus 108.6 ± 32.6 W (mean difference 9.5 W, 95% CI –8.8 to 27.7; p = 0.314) (Figure 4 and Table 1 ).\n\nComparison of isokinetic knee extensor performance between rectus femoris and hamstring tendon graft groups.

However, the wide confidence intervals observed indicate limited precision, and small but potentially relevant differences cannot be excluded given the modest sample size. This suggests that the RF graft, despite involving a component of the quadriceps mechanism, does not result in greater extensor strength deficits than the more commonly used hamstring graft [ 19 , 20 , 24 ].\n\nAll isokinetic parameters assessed in this study—including peak torque (PT), peak torque normalized to body weight (PT/BW), angle at peak torque (aPT), total work (TW), and mean power (PM)—were statistically similar between the rectus femoris (RF) and hamstring tendon (HT) graft groups. These results reinforce the notion that harvesting the superficial rectus femoris tendon, despite its anatomical contribution to the knee extensor mechanism, does not result in inferior quadriceps performance when compared to the conventional hamstring autograft. This is particularly relevant in clinical scenarios where the use of hamstring tendons is limited, such as in revision surgeries or in patients with previous harvest from the contralateral limb. Our findings align with previous literature suggesting that quadriceps‐based grafts provide comparable functional outcomes to hamstring grafts in terms of strength recovery [ 11 , 24 ].\n\nAlthough intergroup comparisons revealed no significant differences, a within‐subject analysis in the RF group demonstrated a substantial quadriceps performance deficit in the operated limb relative to the contralateral, non‐operated side. Significant reductions were observed in peak torque, PT/BW, total work, and mean power, with confidence intervals indicating clinically meaningful differences. These findings suggest that while the RF graft may be comparable to the HT graft at the group level, it is still associated with measurable unilateral extensor weakness. This highlights the importance of interpreting graft‐related performance not only in terms of intergroup comparisons, but also in the context of side‐to‐side functional asymmetry, which has been linked to delayed return to sport and increased risk of reinjury [ 32 ]. Moreover, these results provide further evidence supporting the recommendation that return to pivoting or contact sports should ideally occur no earlier than 9 months postoperatively, when strength symmetry is more likely to be achieved [ 14 ]. Future studies should therefore incorporate both functional performance tests and PROMs to complement isokinetic assessments and provide a more comprehensive basis for RTS decision‐making.\n\nThe unilateral extensor strength deficit observed in our RF group aligns with patterns reported for other graft types. Notably, angle‐specific isokinetic analyses have revealed differences in inter‐limb strength between BPTB and HT graft recipients four to nine months postoperatively, with BPTB patients showing greater extensor torque asymmetry at mid‐range angles compared to HT recipients [ 15 ]. Additionally, studies comparing QT, HT, and BPTB grafts have consistently found reduced limb symmetry indices (LSI) in quadriceps performance favoring the contralateral limb at 6–9 months, particularly pronounced in QT and BPTB groups [ 27 ]. Thus, our findings of significant quadriceps performance asymmetry in the RF group at 6 months postoperatively are consistent with existing evidence, reinforcing that residual unilateral weakness is common across autograft types, though clinically acceptable symmetry (typically LSI ≥ 90%) often remains elusive within this postoperative timeframe.\n\nInterestingly, no significant differences were observed in the angle at peak torque (aPT), either between graft groups or between operated and non‐operated limbs in the RF group. This finding may indicate that, despite measurable strength deficits, the neuromuscular activation pattern during knee extension remains functionally preserved. The aPT is often interpreted as a surrogate for muscle coordination and timing, and its maintenance suggests that graft harvest from the rectus femoris does not substantially alter the kinematic or neuromotor profile of extensor muscle recruitment. This may help explain the comparable group‐level performance observed between RF and HT grafts, even in the presence of unilateral strength reduction [ 24 , 31 ]. Because aPT is best interpreted as a surrogate marker of neuromuscular coordination, these findings should be interpreted cautiously. Our results are consistent with prior angle‐specific analyses, suggesting that extensor recruitment patterns may remain functionally preserved despite strength deficits.\n\nDespite theoretical concerns regarding quadriceps dysfunction following harvest of the RF tendon, our findings indicate that its impact on knee extensor performance is not inferior to that of hamstring tendon grafts at 6 months postoperatively. This supports the growing body of evidence that positions the quadriceps tendon (QT)—including its superficial RF component—as a viable graft source for ACL reconstruction. Biomechanical studies have shown that QT autografts have favorable structural properties, including a greater cross‐sectional area compared to both hamstring and bone–patellar tendon–bone (BPTB) grafts [ 6 , 24 , 25 ]. Clinical outcomes have also been reported to be comparable in terms of knee stability, functional recovery, and graft failure rates when QT is compared to HT and BPTB grafts [ 4 ].\n\nA key advantage of the QT graft lies in its versatility. It can be harvested in partial‐ or full‐thickness configurations, with or without a bone block. Even with anatomical variability, the superficial layer of the rectus femoris can be harvested reliably before merging with deeper layers [ 29 ]. Moreover, soft tissue‐only QT autografts appear to result in fewer donor‐site complications [ 10 ]. Concerns regarding donor‐site hematoma and transient extensor strength deficits do exist, but reports suggest that quadriceps recovery following QT harvest is similar to that of BPTB [ 18 ].\n\nThe clinical interest in using the rectus femoris tendon has grown in recent years. Authors such as Raman et al. [ 21 ], Thamrongskulsiri et al. [ 28 ], Fink et al. [ 13 ], Rego et al. [ 23 ] and Barroso et al. [ 5 ] have described its successful application, particularly in complex or multiligament reconstructions, due to its length and adaptability. Given these advantages, the RF graft appears to be a viable and increasingly recognized option. Future studies should explore long‐term functional outcomes, sport‐specific recovery, and inclusion of female athletes to better define the role of RF grafts in contemporary ACL surgery.\n\nThis study has several limitations. (1) single timepoint (6 months), prone to arthrogenic inhibition and high variability; (2) non‐randomized graft allocation with consecutive recruitment at routine visits, introducing potential selection bias; (3) all‐male cohort, limiting generalizability; (4) single angular velocity (60°/s), not capturing endurance/high‐speed function; (5) absence of PROMs/functional tests; and (6) underpowered between‐group contrasts given the observed variability (e.g., PT difference 5.3 Nm; 95% CI −20.4 to 30.9; very small effect size, low achieved power). Additionally, only isokinetic knee quadriceps performance was evaluated, without complementary assessments of neuromuscular control or return‐to‐sport criteria. Finally, the lack of preoperative baseline data and standardized symmetry indices (e.g., limb symmetry index) limits comparisons with other studies. Further limitations include the absence of blinding of therapists and assessors and lack of preoperative baseline strength values.\n\n\n## Limitations\nThis study has several limitations.

These early data do not address return‐to‐sport timing or graft healing and should not be interpreted as evidence of equivalence (it is not powered for equivalence/non‐inferiority); rather, they support RF as a potential option warranting longer‐term studies incorporating functional tests and patient‐reported outcomes.\n\n\n## AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\nAll authors made substantial contributions to the conception and design of the study, data acquisition and interpretation, drafting or critically revising the manuscript, and approved the final version for publication.

Foram selecionados de maneira aleatória e anônimas 500 exames de ressonância magnética (RM) dos joelhos de 250 mulheres e 250 homens.\n\nO critério de inclusão foi a maturidade esquelética de pacientes de ambos os sexos. Os critérios de exclusão foram exames com deformidade morfológica óssea do joelho (osteófitos), dispositivos médicos implantáveis e evidência de fratura articular prévia.\n\nOs pacientes elegíveis foram identificados pelo banco de imagens de RM do Hospital Hcor disponíveis em sua plataforma e software Clinical Collaboration Platform (Carestream Health, Inc.). No caso de pacientes com exames bilaterais disponíveis, foi analisado apenas o joelho direito.\n\nAs mensurações das distâncias ML e AP no fêmur e tíbia foram realizadas a partir das imagens de RM por método validado na população brasileira em cortes axiais em sequência T2 no próprio software: 1\n\nDimensão AP femoral: a maior distância de eixo AP avaliado no côndilo lateral entre as extremidades mais proeminentes articulares posterior e anterior ( Fig. 1A ).\n\nDimensão ML femoral: distância do eixo bicortical a 9 mm da linha articular posterior do joelho ( Fig. 1B ).\n\nDimensão AP tibial: no nível da inserção tibial do LCP foi utilizada o maior eixo perpendicular a cortical posterior do planalto tibial medial ( Fig. 1C ).\n\nDimensão ML tibial: no nível da inserção tibial do ligamento cruzado posterior (LCP) foi utilizada a maior distância entre as corticais medial e lateral tibial paralelamente a cortical posterior ( Fig. 1D ).\n\nMedida anteroposterior (AP) ( A ), referenciada pela mais anterior e posterior proeminência articular do côndilo femoral lateral, e medida mediolateral (ML) bicortical ( B ), aferida a 9 mm da superfície articular posterior femoral, realizada no nível do corte axial epicondilar. Medida AP ( C ), referenciada pela mais anterior e posterior proeminência articular do planalto tibial, e medida ML ( D ), aferida no maior eixo bicortical da superfície articular tibial, no nível do corte axial da inserção do ligamento cruzado posterior (LCP). ( E ) Medidas AP e ML dos implantes femoral e tibial de artroplastias.\n\nTodas as mensurações foram realizadas por único cirurgião de joelho duas vezes e em dias diferentes. Foram computadas somente as mensurações que apresentaram variação menor que 10% entre na análise intraobservador.\n\nA busca dos fabricantes internacionais de implantes de ATJ foi realizada no site da Instituição Orthopaedic Data Evaluation Panel (ODEP https://www.odep.org.uk/methodology/methodology-for-tkr/ ). Todos os fabricantes internacionais e nacionais foram contactados por e-mail. Também foram feitas buscas das informações em seus sites comerciais a fim de obter os dados associados às medidas ML e AP de seus implantes de ATJ. As mensurações corresponderam ao eixo de maior proeminência AP e ML dos implantes nos dois planos indicados pelos fabricantes ( Fig. 1E ).\n\nForam identificados 20 fabricantes e 25 implantes: Columbus (Aesculap AG), AKS (Baumer), Sigma e Attune (DePuy Synthes), ACS (Implantcast GmbH), NG e PAR (Impol Instrumental e Implantes Ltda.), Gemini e Symphoknee (Waldemar Link GmbH & Co.), Freedom (Maxx Orthopedics), Sphere (Medacta Corp.), Freedom (Meril Life), Advance (Microport Orthopedics Inc.), Orthovasive Indus (Biorad Medisys Pvt Ltd.), Ortosíntese (Ortosintese), BPK-S (Peter Brehm GmbH), Sartori (Sartori), Legion (Smith + Nephew), Scorpio e Triathlon (Stryker), U2 (United Orthopedic Corp.), MetaBio e Rotaflex (Vincula), além de Persona e Nex Gen (Zimmer Biomet).\n\nDados epidemiológicos quanto ao sexo, idade e dimensões morfológicas foram analisados, comparados entre si, e expressos em termos de média e desvio padrão (DP).\n\nPara determinar o implante femoral mais adequado de cada fabricante para cada paciente, priorizou-se a distância mais próxima AP, podendo ser igual, subdimensionada ou hiper dimensionada. A medida de referência ML foi usada paraidentificar os componentes tibiais mais adequados. As análises médias incluíram tanto valores de subcobertura quanto de sobrecobertura para a as medidas AP e ML.\n\nAs relações das dimensões do fêmur e tíbia dos pacientes e as mesmas dimensões das próteses foram relacionadas utilizando a distância euclidiana para comparar sua proximidade em um espaço bidimensional. A fórmula utilizada foi:\n\nForam analisadas as variações médias, máxima, DPs e diferença estatística (valor de p ) das relações entre as medidas anatômicas e dos implantes. Para verificar existência de diferenças significativas entre os tipos de próteses foi realizada a análise de variância (ANOVA). Os pressupostos de normalidade e homogeneidade de variâncias foram verificados pelos testes de Shapiro-Wilk e Levene. O nível de significância adotado foi de p = 0,05.\n\nAs medidas AP e ML dos implantes femorais e tibiais foram agregadas a fim de identificar o ranqueamento dos implantes que mais se customizaram aos joelhos dos pacientes. Sendo assim, os implantes menor variação entre os dispositivos e as morfologias ósseas receberam escores maiores. Para criar um ranqueamento dos implantes de próteses, foi utilizada a normalização dos valores para o intervalo de 0 a 1, seguida da criação de um escore (valor normalizado da tíbia e valor normalizado fêmur). O cálculo amostral foi determinado para um nível de confiança de 90%.\n\n\n## Análise Estatística\nDados epidemiológicos quanto ao sexo, idade e dimensões morfológicas foram analisados, comparados entre si, e expressos em termos de média e desvio padrão (DP).\n\nPara determinar o implante femoral mais adequado de cada fabricante para cada paciente, priorizou-se a distância mais próxima AP, podendo ser igual, subdimensionada ou hiper dimensionada.

As variações médias para as medidas AP foram de 0,98 mm, sendo de 1,11 mm para anatomias maiores que os implantes e de 0,91 mm para implantes maiores que a anatomia. Para as medidas ML a média foi de 3,94 mm, sendo a anatomia maior que os implantes 1,75 mm em média e para implantes maiores que a anatomia 4,15 mm. A maioria dos implantes apresentaram medidas ML maiores do que os fêmures. A melhor relação de medidas morfológicas foi encontrada no Sphere, com divergências médias ML/AP de 2,36 ± 1,66 mm ( Tabela 2 ).\n\nAbreviações: DP, desvio padrão; Max, valor máximo; Min, valor mínimo.\n\nA média de divergência para os fêmures masculinos nas medidas AP/ML foi de 4,71 mm. As variações médias para as medidas AP foram de 1,94 mm, sendo 2,39 mm para anatomias maiores que os implantes e 0,92 mm com implantes maiores que a anatomia. Para as medidas ML a média de divergência foi de 3,81 mm, sendo a anatomia maior que os implantes em média 4,02 mm e os implantes maiores que a anatomia 2,87 mm. A maioria dos implantes apresentaram medidas ML menores que as anatomias. A melhor relação de medidas morfológicas foi encontrada no Triathlon, com divergências médias de relação ML/AP de 3,52 ± 2,69 mm ( Tabela 3 ).\n\nAbreviações: DP, desvio padrão; Max, valor máximo; Min, valor mínimo.\n\nOs resultados dos achados morfológicos tibiais no sexo feminino demonstraram que os componentes apresentaram divergências médias ML/AP de 3,63 mm. O implante Legion apresentou a menor variação média de 0,88 mm de divergência ML para a anatomia. O quase metade das mulheres apresentaram implantes hiperdimensionados em 1,33 mm e subdimensionados 1,26 mm, em média, para a medida ML tibial. A relação AP média demonstrou divergência para as medidas anatômicas de 3,14 mm. A média de implantes com hiperdimensionamento AP foi de 0,85 mm e com sub- de 3,23 mm. Destaca-se o implante Advance, com 202 mulheres apresentando hiperdimensionamento AP, com média de 3,46 mm ( Tabela 4 ).\n\nAbreviações: DP, desvio padrão; Max, valor máximo; Min, valor mínimo.\n\nNa população masculina, os valores de ML e AP tibiais demonstraram que o implante com a melhor relação de medidas morfológicas foi o Persona, com divergências médias de relação ML/AP de 3,27 ± 3,00 mm. O número médio de implantes hiperdimensionados ML foi de 1,77 mm, e de subdimensionados, de 1,99 mm. A relação AP, em média, demonstrou divergência para as medidas anatômicas de 5,54 mm. A média geral de implantes com hiperdimensionamento AP foi de 0,69 mm e a de sub foi 5,78 mm ( Tabela 5 ).\n\nAs Figs. 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 de regressões demonstram os agrupamentos dos implantes nacionais e importados líderes do mercado mundial em ATJ, 15 quanto às medidas ML e AP femorais e tibiais. Os resultados demonstram que os implantes importados se comportam com melhor “customização” morfológica, principalmente nos joelhos masculinos. As maiores divergências se apresentaram para os fêmures femininos.\n\nLinhas de regressão ML versus AP das medidas do fêmur em homens e implantes Baumer, NG, PAR, Ortosintese, MetaBio e Rotaflex.\n\nLinhas de regressão ML versus AP das medidas do fêmur em mulheres e implantes Baumer, NG, PAR, Ortosintese, MetaBio e Rotaflex.\n\nLinhas de regressão ML versus AP das medidas do fêmur em homens e implantes Attune, Sphere, Legion, Triathlon e Persona.\n\nLinhas de regressão ML versus AP das medidas do fêmur em mulheres e implantes Attune, Sphere, Legion, Triathlon e Persona.\n\nLinhas de regressão ML versus AP das medidas da tíbia em homens e implantes Baumer, NG, PAR, Ortosintese, MetaBio e Rotaflex.\n\nLinhas de regressão ML versus AP das medidas da tíbia em mulheres e implantes Baumer, NG, PAR, Ortosintese, MetaBio e Rotaflex.\n\nLinhas de regressão ML versus AP das medidas da tíbia em homens e implantes Attune, Sphere, Legion, Triathlon e Persona.\n\nLinhas de regressão ML versus AP das medidas da tíbia em mulheres e implantes Attune, Sphere, Legion, Triathlon e Persona.\n\nEm mulheres, considerando a acomodação AP/ML para implantes de ATJ, observou-se que o implante U2 apresentou a melhor pontuação estatística, seguido dos implantes Columbus e Legion ( Tabela 6 ). Para os homens, os melhores foram Persona, Advance e Legion ( Tabela 7 ).\n\n\n## Discussão\nOs fabricantes de ATJ comumente utilizam grupos populacionais específicos como referências para o desenvolvimento de seus implantes. Apesar da diversidade étnica em suas amostras, é possível que populações apresentem características próprias de joelhos, o que contribuiria para divergências se comparados a outros grupos étnicos. 10 13 16\n\nOs resultados encontrados demonstram que, em média, as variações morfológicas encontradas entre os implantes e joelhos dos brasileiros não exercem ampla preocupação para cirurgiões em relação aos dimensionamentos bidimensionais femorais e tibiais. No entanto foram encontradas pessoas de ambos os sexos, e em múltiplos implantes, com diferenças maiores que 10mm. Nestes casos, o cirurgião deve considerar modificar os dimensionamentos dos implantes para melhor acomodação anatômica. Essas diferenças influenciam diretamente nas condições biomecânicas do joelho, podendo interferir nos espaços articulares de extensão e flexão assim como na capacidade de intercambiar numerações diferentes de implantes femorais e tibiais, principalmente em dispositivos com ressecção do LCP em determinados fabricantes de implantes.\n\nDestaca-se a importância biomecânica da medida AP para o implante femoral devido a sua influência na estabilidade do joelho e correspondência direta com o dimensionamento do espaço de flexão. O aumento ou diminuição do offset posterior no componente femoral pode alterar o espaço de flexão diretamente, assim como influenciar o espaço de extensão. Isso ocorre dada a relação do contato capsular e de partes moles posteriores do joelho, que pode contribuir para a diminuição ou aumento do espaço de extensão. 17 18 Os resultados do presente estudo demonstram que, em mulheres, nenhum implante femoral apresentou variações máximas de divergências médias maiores que 3 mm para a medida AP. No entanto, quatro implantes apresentaram média com divergências maiores que 3 mm em homens (PAR e NG, Nex Gen, Indus). Desta forma, os componentes femorais demandam mais planejamento devido a influência nos espaços articulares caso seja necessário modificação do dimensionamento AP, principalmente nos homens brasileiros.\n\nCirurgiões devem se atentar para risco de invasão de corte ( notching ) na cortical anterior quando a divergência de medida AP for maior que 3 mm devido ao maior risco de fraturas periprotéticas. 19 Nenhum implante femoral feminino apresentou média maior que 3 mm. No entanto, os resultados de fêmures masculinos demandam atenção, já que 10 implantes (Scorpio, Sartori, Ortosintese, MetaBio, PAR, Baumer, NG, Sigma, Nex Gen, Indus) apresentaram divergência na maioria das amostras ósseas maiores que 3 mm comparados ao melhor implante AP, aumentando risco de invasão do corte cortical a depender do tipo de guia utilizado no procedimento.\n\nEm relação a divergência na acomodação dos implantes femorais para a medida ML, observou-se maior relevância clínica nas mulheres, com valores médios para a cobertura ideal variando em 4,22 mm. Isso indica que os implantes estudados apresentam relação de acomodação ML menos “customizadas” para os fêmures das mulheres brasileiras se comparado aos homens. Os resultados reforçam a necessidade de implantes estreitos para favorecer essa população. A presença de implantes sobre aumento mediolateral é um fato clínico relevante, pois cirurgiões podem precisar subdimensionar o implante a fim de não proporcionar contato com estruturas capsuloligamentares periarticulares que potencializam dor pós-operatória. Ressalta-se que, quando subdimensionar o implante femoral é necessário para acomodação ML influencia diretamente nos dimensionamentos dos espaços articulares, principalmente o de flexão.\n\nA relação ML dos fêmures de homens foram mais largas comparado às mulheres. Esta mesma característica foi demonstrada na população hispânica no estudo de McNamara et al. 12 Diante destes achados, seria oportuno que existissem implantes estreitos que sustentam a mesma distância AP com menor dimensão ML, assim como implantes largos com a mesma distância AP e distâncias ML mais alongadas. Isso ofereceria melhor acomodação óssea a depender da variação de cada paciente, já que a falta de cobertura óssea ML femoral leva a apoios distantes das corticais. Apoio em osso esponjoso com menor resistência mecânica potencializa complicações, como afundamento ósseo tanto no fêmur quanto na tíbia.\n\nVale notar que as diferenças médias milimétricas para a distância ML ficaram abaixo de 5 mm, no geral. Essa distância distribuída nos compartimentos medial e lateral não representa relevância clínica para desfecho, sendo aceitável como sub- ou sobredimensionamento do implante sem comprometimento técnico no fêmur e tíbia.\n\nEm relação aos resultados observados para os implantes tibiais observou-se que os implantes se acomodam melhor nas anatomias das mulheres comparado aos homens, principalmente devido à distância AP. Ainda que possa diminuir o apoio cortical posterior e, consequentemente, expor o implante a qualidade óssea esponjosa, não houve preocupação com hiperdimensionamento, no qual o implante está em contato com estruturas capsulares e tendíneas posteriores, podendo provocar desconforto e dor pós-operatória. 20 21\n\nEstudos sobre os aspectos morfológicos dos joelhos populacionais são amplamente observados com resultados satisfatórios para o desfecho adaptativo anatômico. Yue et al. 22 Cheng et al. 5 9 estudaram as relações antropométricas tibiais proximais asiáticas e compararam com outras populações, demonstrando diferenças morfológicas articulares. Além disso, Vaidya et al. 23 Urabe et al. 24 e Chaichankul et al. 25 estudaram as relações dos componentes de ATJ com as morfologias epifisárias nas populações indiana, japonesa e tailandesa, demonstrando boa relação de correspondência de mensuração. Desta forma, ainda que existam variações anatômicas observadas nas diferentes populações mundiais para uma customização plena dos implantes disponíveis para a ATJ, os dimensionamentos disponíveis atendem, de maneia geral, a cobertura óssea e funcionalidade.\n\nAinda assim, Ho et al. 26 encontraram que a relação de alguns implantes pode não ser satisfatória para a população chinesa . Em relação ao ranqueamento dimensional AP versus ML tanto para o componente femoral e tibial observou-se destaque para os implantes importados com as melhores proporções para ambos os sexos. Em relação aos implantes nacionais, destacou-se o implante Rotaflex, ranqueado na sétima e sexta posição para mulheres e homens. Neste contexto, observa-se oportunidade de otimização para o desenvolvimento morfológico de implantes nacionais a fim de melhorar o “vestimento” articular para nossa população.\n\nO presente estudo possui limitações e os resultados devem ser analisados com senso crítico. Não foram analisados os perfis biométricos de altura e peso dos pacientes, atrapalhando nossa compreensão de como as divergências anatômicas da população podem estar relacionadas a outras características biotípicas, assim como as variações de tamanho articulares que poderiam influenciar na customização em acordo com os números de componentes de cada fabricante.\n\nAdicionalmente, não foram analisados os perfis de miscigenação das amostras para determinar se os grupos estudados poderiam ter vieses de raça ou cor. Os cortes ósseos parametrizados no estudo radiológico podem não corresponder aos operativos, a depender das condições cirúrgicas (hipoplasias ou defeitos ósseos). Essa divergência agregaria viés de transposição aos resultados.\n\nOutro fator limitante do estudo foi não avaliar as medidas tibiais AP laterais em implantes assimétricos. É possível que os implantes anatômicos podem apresentar melhores acomodações laterais que os implantes não anatômicos, fato não analisado.\n\nAs relações de intercambialidade entre os implantes femorais e tibiais para os casos de divergências de dimensionamento ósseo nos pacientes também não foram analisadas.\n\nO ranqueamento realizado corresponde aos achados morfológicos da população analisada e pode não corresponder a toda população brasileira.\n\n\n## Conclusão\nOs implantes estudados apresentam satisfatória cobertura óssea articular dos joelhos de população brasileira, com pequenas variações de dimensões. Entretanto, foram encontrados resultados com diferenças maiores do que 10 mm. Implantes importados se demonstraram mais customizáveis que os brasileiros em nossa população.\n\n"

We randomly selected 500 anonymous magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the knees of 250 women and 250 men.\n\nThe inclusion criterion was skeletal maturity of male or female patients. The exclusion criteria were scans showing morphological knee bone deformities (osteophytes), implantable medical devices, and evidence of previous joint fractures.\n\nWe identified the eligible patients through the MRI database of the Hospital Hcor in its Clinical Collaboration Platform and software (Carestream Health, Inc.). We analyzed only the right knee from patients with bilateral imaging.\n\nUsing the software, we measured the ML and AP distances from the femur and tibia, from axial, T2-weighted MRI scans obtained using a method validated for the Brazilian population: 1\n\nFemoral AP dimension: the greatest distance in the AP axis at the lateral condyle between the most prominent posterior and anterior articular ends ( Fig. 1A ).\n\nFemoral ML dimension: distance from the bicortical axis to 9 mm from the posterior joint line of the knee ( Fig. 1B ).\n\nTibial AP dimension: the largest axis perpendicular to the posterior cortex of the medial tibial plateau at the level of the tibial PCL ( Fig. 1C ).\n\nTibial ML dimension: the greatest distance between the medial and lateral tibial cortices parallel to the posterior cortex at the level of the tibial posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) ( Fig. 1D ).\n\nAnteroposterior (AP) measurement ( A ) per the most anterior and posterior articular prominence of the lateral femoral condyle and bicortical mediolateral (ML) distance ( B ) 9 mm from the femoral posterior articular surface at the level of the epicondylar axial cut. AP measurement ( C ) according to the most anterior and posterior articular prominence of the tibial plateau and ML distance ( D ) at the largest bicortical axis of the tibial articular surface at the level of the axial section of the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) attachment. AP and ML measurements ( E ) from femoral and tibial arthroplasty implants.\n\nA single knee surgeon performed all measurements twice, on different days. We included only measurements showing a variation lower than 10% in the intraobserver analyses.\n\nWe searched for international TKA implant manufacturers on the Orthopaedic Data Evaluation Panel's website (ODEP; https://www.odep.org.uk/methodology/methodology-for-tkr/ ). All international and Brazilian manufacturers were contacted by email. We also searched for information on their commercial websites to obtain data on the ML and AP measurements of their TKA implants. The measurements corresponded to the axis of greatest AP and ML prominence of the implants in the two planes indicated by the manufacturers ( Fig. 1E ).\n\nWe identified 20 manufactures and 25 implants: Columbus (Aesculap AG), AKS (Baumer), Sigma and Attune (DePuy Synthes), ACS (Implantcast GmbH), NG and PAR (Impol Instrumental e Implantes Ltda.), Gemini and Symphoknee (Waldemar Link GmbH & Co. ), Freedom (Maxx Orthopedics), Sphere (Medacta Corp.), Freedom (Meril Life), Advance (Microport Orthopedics Inc.), Orthovasive Indus (Biorad Medisys Pvt Ltd.), Ortosíntese (Ortosintese), BPK-S (Peter Brehm GmbH), Sartori (Sartori), Legion (Smith + Nephew), Scorpio and Triathlon (Stryker), U2 (United Orthopedic Corp.), MetaBio and Rotaflex (Vincula), as well as Persona and Nex Gen (Zimmer Biomet).\n\nWe analyzed and compared epidemiological data regarding gender, age, and morphological dimensions expressed as mean and standard deviation (SD) values.\n\nTo determine the most appropriate femoral implant from each manufacturer for each patient, we prioritized the closest AP distance, which could be equal, undersized, or oversized. The ML reference measurement identified the most appropriate tibial components. The mean analyses included both undercoverage and overcoverage values for the AP and ML measurements.\n\nWe used the Euclidean distance to correlate the femur and tibia dimensions to the prosthesis dimensions, comparing their proximity in a two-dimensional space. The Euclidean distance formula was the following:\n\nWe analyzed the mean and maximum variations, SDs, and statistical difference ( p -value) of the relationships between the anatomical and implant measurements. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) test determined the existence of significant differences between the types of prostheses. The Shapiro-Wilk and Levene tests verified the assumptions of normality and homogeneity of variances. The significance level was set at p = 0.05.\n\nWe aggregated AP and ML measurements of the femoral and tibial implants to rank the devices according to their match with the knees of our patients. As such, implants with the smallest differences from bone morphologies received higher scores. To create a ranking of the prosthetic implants, we normalized the values to the range of 0 to 1, then established a score (normalized tibial value and normalized femur value). Sample calculation considered a 90% confidence level.\n\n\n## Statistical Analysis\nWe analyzed and compared epidemiological data regarding gender, age, and morphological dimensions expressed as mean and standard deviation (SD) values.\n\nTo determine the most appropriate femoral implant from each manufacturer for each patient, we prioritized the closest AP distance, which could be equal, undersized, or oversized.

Sample calculation considered a 90% confidence level.\n\n\n## Results\nWe assessed 500 patients (250 men and 250 women). Their mean age was 51 years, with an average of 53 years for women and 49 years for men ( Table 1 ).\n\nFor men, the mean femoral AP measurement was of 69.92 ± 5.14mm, and the mean femoral ML width was of 76.22 ± 4.83 mm. Women presented a mean AP measurement of 64.74 ± 3.30 mm, and a mean ML width of 68.00 ± 3.65 mm ( Table 1 ).\n\nFor women, the average divergence between the implants and the femoral AP/ML ratios was 4.23 mm. The average variations for the AP measurements were 0.98 mm, with 1.11 mm for anatomies larger than the implants, and 0.91 mm for implants larger than the anatomy. The mean ML measurements were 3.94 mm, with the anatomy larger than the implants by an average of 1.75 mm, and 4.15 mm for implants larger than the anatomy. Most implants had ML measurements larger than the femurs. The best morphological measurement ratios were found in Medacta Sphere, with a mean ML/AP divergence of 2.36 ± 1.66 mm ( Table 2 ).\n\nAbbreviations: Max, maximum value; Min, minimum value; SD, standard deviation.\n\nFor men, the mean divergence in femoral AP/ML measurements was 4.71 mm. The mean variations for AP measurements were 1.94 mm, with 2.39 mm for anatomies larger than the implants and 0.92 mm for implants larger than the anatomy. For ML measurements, the mean divergence was 3.81 mm, with the anatomy larger than the implants by an average of 4.02 mm and implants larger than the anatomy by 2.87 mm. Most implants had ML measurements smaller than the anatomies. The best morphological measurement ratios were found in Triathlon, with a mean divergence in the ML/AP ratio of 3.5 ± 2.69 mm ( Table 3 ).\n\nAbbreviations: Max, maximum value; Min, minimum value; SD, standard deviation.\n\nTibial morphological findings in females demonstrated that the components presented mean ML/AP divergences of 3.63 mm. The Legion implant presented the smallest mean variation, with an ML divergence of 0.88 mm. Virtually half of the women had implants, on average, oversized by 1.33 mm and undersized by 1.26 mm for the tibial ML measurements. The mean AP ratio demonstrated a divergence from the anatomical measurements of 3.14 mm. The mean AP over- and undersize values were 0.85 mm and 3.23 mm, respectively. The Advance implant stood out, with 202 women presenting a mean AP oversize of 3.46 mm ( Table 4 ).\n\nAbbreviations: Max, maximum value; Min, minimum value; SD, standard deviation.\n\nFor the male population, the tibial ML and AP ratios showed that the implant with the best morphological measurement ratio was the Persona device, with a mean ML/AP ratio divergence of 3.27 ± 3.00 mm. The mean ML over- and undersize values were 1.77 mm and 1.99 mm respectively. The mean AP ratio had a divergence from the anatomical measurements of 5.54 mm. The overall mean AP over- and undersizing were 0.69 and 5.78 mm respectively ( Table 5 ).\n\nFigs. 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 show regression analyses of the world's leading TKA implants, 15 including Brazilian and imported devices, regarding femoral and tibial ML and AP measurements. The results demonstrate that imported implants perform better with morphological “customization,” especially in male knees. The highest discrepancies occurred in the female femurs.\n\nMediolateral (ML) versus anterolateral (AP) regression lines of femoral measurements in men and Baumer, NG, PAR, Ortosintese, MetaBio, and Rotaflex implants.\n\nMediolateral (ML) versus anterolateral (AP) regression lines of femoral measurements in women and the Baumer, NG, PAR, Ortosintese, MetaBio, and Rotaflex implants.\n\nFig. 4 Mediolateral (ML) versus anterolateral (AP) regression lines of femoral measurements in men and the Attune, Sphere, Legion, Triathlon, and Persona implants.\n\nMediolateral (ML) versus anterolateral (AP) regression lines of femoral measurements in women and the Attune, Sphere, Legion, Triathlon, and Persona implants.\n\nMediolateral (ML) versus anterolateral (AP) regression lines of tibial measurements in men and the Baumer, NG, PAR, Ortosintese, MetaBio, and Rotaflex implants.\n\nMediolateral (ML) versus anterolateral (AP) regression lines of tibial measurements in women and the Baumer, NG, PAR, Ortosintese, MetaBio, and Rotaflex implants.\n\nMediolateral (ML) versus anterolateral (AP) regression lines of tibial measurements in men and the Attune, Sphere, Legion, Triathlon, and Persona implants.\n\nMediolateral (ML) versus anterolateral (AP) regression lines of tibial measurements in women and the Attune, Sphere, Legion, Triathlon, and Persona implants.\n\nFor women, considering AP/ML accommodation for TKA devices, the U2 implant had the best statistical score, followed by the Columbus and Legion implants ( Table 6 ). For men, the best devices were Persona, Advance, and Legion ( Table 7 ).\n\n\n## Discussion\nManufacturers of TKA commonly use specific population groups as references for developing their implants. Although their sample may have some ethnic diversity, selected populations can present with distinct knee characteristics, contributing to divergences in comparison with other ethnic groups. 10 13 16\n\nThe results demonstrated that, on average, the morphological variations between implants and knees from Brazilian patients do not pose a major concern to surgeons regarding two-dimensional femoral and tibial sizing. However, we noted differences greater than 10 mm in patients from both genders, in several implants. In such cases, the surgeon should consider modifying implant sizing for better anatomical accommodation. These discrepancies directly influence the knee's biomechanical conditions, as they can interfere with the extension and flexion joint spaces as well as the ability to interchange different femoral and tibial implant sizes, especially for devices that require resection of the PCL.\n\nThe biomechanical importance of the femoral implant AP measurement stood out due to its influence on knee stability and direct correspondence with the dimensioning of the flexion space. Increasing or decreasing the posterior offset of the femoral component can directly alter the flexion space and influence the extension space. This occurs because the relationship between the capsular contact and the posterior soft tissues can contribute to the decrease or increase of extension space. 17 18 Our results demonstrated that, in women, no femoral implant presented maximum variations for mean divergences greater than 3 mm for the AP measurement. However, four implants presented mean AP divergences greater than 3 mm in men (PAR, NG, Nex Gen, Indus). Therefore, femoral components require greater planning due to the influence on joint spaces if the AP dimension requires modification, especially in Brazilian men.\n\nSurgeons must be aware of the risk of notching in the anterior cortex when the AP divergence is greater than 3 mm, given the higher risk of periprosthetic fractures. 19 No female femoral implant presented an average divergence greater than 3 mm. However, the results in male femurs require better attention, since 10 implants (Scorpio, Sartori, Ortosintese, MetaBio, PAR, Baumer, NG, Sigma, Nex Gen, Indus) had divergences to bone samples greater than 3 mm compared with the best AP implant, increasing the risk of invasion of the cortical section depending on the type of guide used in the procedure.\n\nRegarding the discrepancy in femoral implant accommodation for the ML measurement, the greater clinical relevance occurred in women, with mean values for ideal coverage varying by 4.22 mm. This indicates that the studied implants have a less “customized” ML accommodation ratio for the femurs of Brazilian women than men. The results reinforce the need for narrow implants to benefit this population. The presence of implants with mediolateral augmentation is a significant clinical fact, as surgeons might need to undersize them to avoid contact with periarticular capsuloligamentous structures, leading to potential postoperative pain. It is noteworthy that undersizing a femoral implant for mediolateral accommodation directly influences joint space size, especially for flexion.\n\nThe ML ratio of male femurs was wider compared with female ones. McNamara et al. reported this same characteristic in a Hispanic population. 12 Given these findings, it would be appropriate to have narrow implants that support the same AP distance with a smaller ML dimension, as well as wide implants with the same AP distance and more elongated ML dimension. These would provide better bone accommodation for each patient, as the lack of mediolateral femoral bone coverage leads to support distant from the cortices, such as in cancellous bone with lower mechanical resistance. Support in cancellous bone could cause complications, such as femoral and tibial subsidence.\n\nIt is worth noting that the mean differences for the ML distance were usually below 5 mm. This distance in the medial and lateral compartments does not have clinical relevance to the outcome, being accepted as implant under- or oversizing with no technical compromise to the femur and tibia.\n\nIn our study, tibial implants had a better fit in female than male anatomy, mainly due to the AP distance. Although it may decrease posterior cortical support and, as a result, expose the implant to cancellous bone, there was no concern for oversizing, in which the implant contacts the posterior capsular and tendinous structures, potentially causing postoperative discomfort and pain. 20 21\n\nSeveral studies on knee morphological aspects reported satisfactory anatomical adaptation outcomes. Yue et al. 22 and Cheng et al. 5 9 reported the proximal tibial anthropometric relationships of Asian subjects and compared them with findings from other populations, demonstrating joint morphological differences. Also, Vaidya et al., 23 Urabe et al., 24 and Chaichankul et al. 25 analyzed the correlations between TKA components and epiphyseal morphologies in Indian, Japanese, and Thai populations, and reported good measurement correspondence. Thus, although anatomical variations in different global populations compromise the full customization of TKA implants, the available sizes often meet bone coverage and functionality requirements.\n\nNevertheless, Ho et al. 26 found that the relation of some implants may not be satisfactory for the Chinese population. In the AP versus ML dimensional ranking for both the femoral and tibial components, imported implants stood out as they showed the best proportions for both genders. Regarding Brazilian devices, the Rotaflex implant stood out, ranking seventh and sixth for both women and men. In this context, there is an opportunity to optimize the morphological development of Brazilian implants to improve joint fit for our population.\n\nThe present study has some limitations, and its results require a critical analysis. We did not assess the patients' height and weight (biometric profile), which hindered our understanding of whether the anatomical differences in the population might result from other biotypical characteristics, as well as joint size variations that could influence customization according to each manufacturer's component numbers.\n\nFurthermore, we did not analyze the ethnicity profile of our sample to determine whether there is some race or color-related bias. The bone sections standardized in the radiological study may not correspond to operative ones, depending on surgical conditions (for instance, hypoplasia or bone defects). This divergence might have added a transposition bias to our results.\n\nAnother limiting factor of the study was the lack of evaluation of lateral AP tibial measurements in asymmetrical implants. Although anatomical implants may offer better lateral accommodation than nonanatomical implants, we did not analyze this fact.\n\nMoreover, we did not analyze the interchangeable correlation between femoral and tibial implants for cases of bone sizing discrepancies.\n\nOur ranking corresponds to the morphological findings of the analyzed sample and may not represent the entire Brazilian population.\n\n\n## Conclusion\nThe implants studied provided satisfactory bone coverage in the knees of the Brazilian population, mostly with small variations in dimension. However, we observed some differences greater than 10 mm. Imported implants proved to be more customizable than Brazilian implants in the Brazilian population.\n\n"

It is a growing procedure worldwide. 1 2 As the number of primary TKAs increases, so do TKA revision rates. In the United States, TKA revisions account for ∼ 10% of primary arthroplasties. 1\n\nTotal knee arthroplasty revision is a challenging procedure for surgeons due to the complexity of bone loss and ligamentous failure. A primary challenge is determining the joint line (JL) height due to the existing bone loss. Restoring the physiological JL positioning is a crucial principle in TKA revision to improve range of motion, optimize extensor function, and maintain normal knee kinematics. 3\n\nSeveral authors have studied methods for JL estimation using anatomical markers, such as the fibular head, the tibial tuberosity, and epicondylar distances. 3 4 It is worth noting that studies in some population groups may differ in their anatomical aspects from other ethnic groups. 5 6 7\n\nIn this context, the objective of the present study was to analyze a constant ratio between the anatomical markers of the knee, that is, the clinical medial epicondyle distance (MED), lateral epicondyle distance (LED), and condylar bicortical axis (CBA) to facilitate estimating JL positioning in TKA revision procedures in the Brazilian population.\n\n\n## Materials and Methods\nThe Ethics Committee of Universidade Federal de São Paulo approved the present study under number CAAE 83009724.5.0000.5505. We randomly and anonymously selected 500 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the knees of 250 women and 250 men.\n\nThe inclusion criterion was skeletally mature male or female patients.\n\nThe exclusion criteria were tests showing morphological knee bone deformity (osteophytes), implantable medical devices, and evidence of previous joint fractures.\n\nWe identified eligible patients in the institutional MRI database available on the Clinical Collaboration Platform (Carestream Health). For patients with bilateral scans, we analyzed the right knee alone.\n\nWe evaluated MED and LED at the femoral JL in coronal T2-weighted MRI and the CBA distance in axial T2-weighted MRI using the software. Measurements were in millimeters (mm).\n\nCBA distance: 15mm anterior to the posterior JL at the distance from the femoral mediolateral bicortical axis and the level of the two femoral epicondyles on an axial MRI scan ( Fig. 1.1 ).\n\nFemoral MED: Distance from the most proximal and prominent point of the crest of the clinical medial epicondyle to the distal articular point of the medial femoral condyle on a coronal MRI scan ( Fig. 1.2 ).\n\nFemoral LED: Distance from the most proximal and prominent point of the lateral epicondyle of the epicondylar crest to the distal articular point of the lateral femoral condyle on a coronal MRI scan ( Fig. 1.3 ).\n\nFig. 1.1 expresses the measurement of the distance from the condylar bicortical axis (CBA); Fig. 1.2 demonstrates the medial epicondylar distance to the joint line (MED); and Fig. 1.3 demonstrates the lateral epicondylar distance to the joint line (LED).\n\nA single knee surgeon performed all measurements twice on different days. We only computed measurements with < 10% variation in the intraobserver analysis.\n\nEpidemiological data, including age, gender, and bone morphological distances, underwent statistical analysis for mean and standard deviation (SD) values.\n\nThe sampling methodology and sample calculations considered a 95% confidence interval (CI).\n\nFor each of the 500 pairs of LED versus CBA and MED versus CBA values, we calculated ratios for male and female subjects:\n\n\n## Results\nThe mean age of the patients was 50.91 ± 14.76 years old. The mean age was 48.82 ± 15.43 years old for males and 53.01 ± 13.73 years old for females. The mean distance from the CBA was 72.11 ± 5.93 mm, 76.21 ± 4.83 mm in men and 68.00 ± 3.64 mm for women. The mean MED and LED were 33.39 ± 3.50 mm and 26.32 ± 4.08 mm, including 35.20 ± 3.15 mm and 27.11 ± 4.60 mm in males and 31.58 ± 2.86 mm and 25.53 ± 3.25 mm in females ( Table 1 ).\n\nAbbreviations : CBA, condylar bicortical axis; LED, distance from the lateral epicondyle to the joint line; MED, distance from the medial epicondyle to the joint line; SD, standard deviation.\n\nFor females, the lateral epicondyle ratio was 95%CI = 0.3720–0.3815 with a margin of error of ± 0.0048 and the medial epicondyle ratio was 95%CI = 0.4599–0.4707 with a margin of error of ± 0.0054. For males, the lateral epicondyle ratio was 95%CI = 0.3559–0.3671 with a margin of error of ± 0.0056 and the medial epicondyle ratio was 95%CI = 0.4568–0.4668 with a margin of error of ± 0.0050. There is evidence that the actual lateral or medial epicondyle ratio and the CBA distance are within the previously mentioned intervals with 95% confidence.\n\nThus, we established the following formulas for JL determination about CBA, MED, and LED:\n\n\n## Discussion\nThe relationship between the epicondylar anatomical references and the knee biepicondylar distance for potential parameterization and determination of the femoral JL positioning was satisfactory in the Brazilian population, with adequate metric ratios in males and females.\n\nIn revision TKAs, maintaining joint height is fundamental for preserving the postoperative biomechanical functionality of the knee and ensures good joint mobility and stability. However, the technical difficulties in determining this anatomical reference are relevant due to bone loss. The surgical sacrifice of JL positioning results in a greater risk of joint biomechanical impairment and patellar wear, overload, and instability due to ligament laxity or excessive tension. 8 9 10 Modifying the JL positioning by 8 mm leads to significant functional changes and worse clinical outcomes in the postoperative follow-up. 11 12\n\nStudies investigated the relationship between the JL and anatomical structures as a reference. These studies tried to establish intraoperative parameters to identify the JL and lateral and medial epicondyles, which are prominent and fundamental structures with a good and precise relationship between them. 3 4 However, we did not find studies in the literature determining these specific parameters for the Brazilian population.\n\nIt is worth noting that several populations, including Caucasians, Americans, Asians, and Europeans, present variable knee morphological aspects, demonstrating that anatomical features may differ in some ethnicities. 6 13 14 15 16 As such, it is essential to analyze joint parameters from mixed-race populations, such as the Brazilian population, to increase the reliability of joint morphological data. The significance of studying specific populations relies on the world's ethnic diversity and its potential influences on anatomical characteristics of the population. Thus, the present study provides Brazilian surgeons with an alternative for improving the positioning of the femoral component, especially in revision TKA, to contribute to another potential accuracy parameter for JL estimative.\n\nThe present study evaluated the relationship between JL positioning based on evident anatomical parameters (the epicondyles) in MRI scans during a revision TKA due to their greater ease of identification and measurements of epicondylar distances compared with simple radiographs. It is easy to observe the bicondylar distance during surgery; in contrast, the prominent epicondylar points may provide some difficulty in accurate identification, but it is still possible to map them intraoperatively.\n\nOur results revealed the possibility of applying a constant multiplier to the CBA distances during TKA surgery with bone loss to estimate, from the medial, lateral, or both epicondyles, JL positioning with 95%CI, adding greater accuracy and safety to the Brazilian population. On average, MED was more proximal to LED in 27% of males and 23% of females. The existence of two parameters for epicondyle-based JL estimative can increase surgical accuracy for this determination as, depending on the anatomical features of each patient and surgical joint approach issues, one epicondyle may be more feasible for identification than the other.\n\nJoint line positioning from the medial epicondyle is well-studied and established in the current literature, suggesting fixed distances from 23 mm to 35 mm depending on the biotypical relationships of the patients. 3 4 17 Other authors evaluated JL positioning from the fibular head. They found a relationship of 4 mm to 22 mm, demonstrating that the epicondyle is the least variable parameter when compared with the fibular head for the same purpose. 3 4 18 19 Rajagopal et al. 8 studied the proportionality relationship between the interepicondylar distance and the epicondyles to the articular surface, which was constant in the English population, concluding that this measurement can predict the JL line positioning.\n\nThe results of the present study have limitations, requiring their critical analysis by the reader. We did not record biometric profiles, that is, height and weight of the patients, to understand whether the anatomical divergences of the population may be related to other biotypical features. We did not analyze the mixed profile of the sample to determine whether the groups had race or color biases. The bone sections parameterized in the radiological study may not correspond to those performed by a surgeon depending on conditions such as bone hypoplasia or defects, a fact potentially adding bias when transposing our results for these cases.\n\n\n## Conclusion\nThe distance from the femoral condylar bicortical axis can be a reference for determining JL positioning from the distances of the medial and lateral femoral epicondyles.\n\n"

            "full_raw": "\n## Introdução\nA artroplastia total de joelho (ATJ) é a cirurgia considerada padrão-ouro para o estágio final da gonartrose, e, embora os desfechos clínicos deste procedimento sejam amplamente favoráveis, estima-se que aproximadamente 10% dos pacientes se mantêm insatisfeitos com a cirurgia. 1 2\n\nDiante da crescente demanda dessa cirurgia e, levando-se em consideração o fato de que elas são realizadas cada vez mais em pacientes adultos jovens, 3 é notória a necessidade e a busca de resultados cirúrgicos de maior qualidade visando a longevidade dos implantes, a percepção mais fisiológica da articulação, a melhor funcionalidade do membro inferior, e menores traumas cirúrgicos. 4\n\nNesse contexto, novos avanços tecnológicos, tais como instrumentação e guias específicos, e a cirurgia assistida por computador (navegada) e/ou automação (robótica) buscam melhor customização e levar em conta a fisiologia e o equilíbrio dos ligamentos de cada paciente a fim de melhorar o planejamento cirúrgico tridimensionalmente, para aumentar a precisão do alinhamento e do posicionamento do implante. 4\n\nEsses conceitos estão sendo apresentados e introduzidos no mercado assistencial das artroplastias com o propósito de melhorar a compreensão mecânica do membro inferior, o mapeamento articular e funcional do joelho, assim como a precisão e a confiabilidade cirúrgicas para aumentar a satisfação dos pacientes. No entanto, como a incorporação de tecnologias novas geralmente está associada a custos maiores, é fundamental que os cirurgiões compreendam as inovações para as ATJs para que desenvolvam senso crítico em relação às suas práticas e visualizem como usar adequadamente essas novas ferramentas para melhorar os resultados cirúrgicos. 5 6\n\nO objetivo deste artigo é descrever as novas tecnologias em ATJ associadas ao uso da navegação, da robótica e dos implantes customizados, e discutir seus conceitos atuais, vantagens e limitações, para auxiliar o leitor a identificar como elas podem contribuir para o desenvolvimento técnico e melhorar os desfechos das artroplastias do joelho.\n\n\n## Implantes Customizados\nOs primeiros dispositivos para artroplastia do joelho foram introduzidos na década de 1970; desde então, foram submetidos a diversas alterações, que incluem técnica cirúrgica e desenho dos implantes. 7 Um implante é produzido com base nos parâmetros dimensionais anatômicos de um grupo populacional definido, o que pode levar a inadequações de ajuste entre os componentes protéticos e a anatomia articular em outras populações. Estudos realizados em populações não caucasianas, como indianos, chineses, malaios e coreanos, por exemplo, 8 9 10 11 12 demonstraram relações antropométricas diversas e diferentes das apresentadas por caucasianos. Na comparação destas populações, foram identificadas discrepâncias significativas com os modelos de próteses comerciais, o que pode ter efeito direto sobre os resultados da artroplastia. 8 9 10 11 12 A anatomia pode variar com o gênero, a etnia, o biotipo e as alterações fenotípicas adquiridas.\n\nO desenvolvimento tecnológico promove terapias ortopédicas mais “personalizadas” e centradas nas condições próprias de cada indivíduo. Embora atualmente se trate de uma tendência, a individualização terapêutica remonta a Hipócrates, em seus dizeres: “é mais importante saber que tipo de pessoa tem uma doença do que saber que tipo de doença uma pessoa tem”. 13\n\nA medicina individualizada está cada vez mais presente no campo das artroplastias, na busca por melhores desfechos. A ATJ personalizada é estimulada por quatro grandes pilares: 1) eixo mecânico mais adaptado à biomecânica individual; 14 15 2) variações anatômicas que não se enquadram em formatos de implantes predefinidos devido à variabilidade fenotípica articular; 3) evolução tecnológica que permite maior e melhor conhecimento e avaliação biomecânica intraoperatória; e 4) a pressão comercial dos fabricantes para massificar a utilização de seus produtos novos. 16\n\nNesse contexto, os componentes customizados foram desenvolvidos para um revestimento fisiológico que respeite a geometria e os limites ósseos, para evitar hiper ou hipodimensionamento anatômico e reduzir as chances de impactos e atritos em partes moles ou falta de cobertura articular adequada, associado a uma cinemática mais fisiológica. No entanto, ainda que se defenda o restabelecimento anatomofisiológico articular individualizado, é preciso refletir que, por vezes, a biomecânica natural de determinado paciente pode ser fator causal, ou de risco, para a dor e a disfunção articular.\n\nOs implantes customizados permitem definições próprias do sulco troclear de maneira personalizada, o que favorece a cinemática patelofemoral independentemente dos formatos condilares femorais, que também podem ser fabricados com raios de curvaturas individuais. Essa particularização que potencializa benefício cinemático ao implante pode ainda contribuir com menor necessidade de compensação para modificar a rotação femoral para o equilíbrio do espaço ( gap ) de flexão. Obviamente, esta condição seria dependente da ausência de assimetrias tensionais ligamentares, que exigiriam liberação de partes moles a fim de se restabelecer o equilíbrio do gap . 17 18 19 O restabelecimento fisiológico e anatômico da curvatura condilar posterior aumenta os espaços de flexão e extensão. É preciso destacar a influência do raio de curvatura condilar femoral, porque sua relação com a cápsula posterior também interfere no dimensionamento do gap de extensão, condição que o cirurgião deve ter em mente ao dimensionar a projeção posterior ( off set) no planejamento de artroplastia em pacientes com joelhos em flexo ou hiperextensão. 20 21 Na busca por uma artroplastia fisiológica, em que o paciente não perceba seu joelho “artificial” nas rotinas diárias, desenvolveu-se um questionário para a mensuração do desfecho. 22\n\nA ATJ personalizada deve, conceitualmente, manter ou procurar restaurar: 1) a percepção de uma articulação normal; 2) a biomecânica “funcional” (quando a anatomia nativa não é considerada patológica), a saber: a) os eixos cinemáticos nativos; b) a orientação nativa da linha articular; c) a tensão nativa de partes moles; e d) a cinemática e cinética articulares nativas durante atividades diárias; 3) a transferência adequada de estresse mecânico entre as interfaces; 4) o arco de movimento articular nativo; 5) a macro e microestabilidades articulares; 6) a resistência do polietileno ao desgaste e à fixação sólida do implante, o que contribui para sua sobrevida sem restrição às atividades; e 7) proporcionar uma recuperação rápida e sem complicações. 2\n\nDiante dos novos desafios conceituais que os implantes customizados trazem com relação aos princípios técnicos clássicos da cirurgia de ATJ, binários entre a técnica da ressecção mensurada ou técnica do equilíbrio dos espaços ( gap balancing ), 23 Lee et al. 24 propuseram um conceito novo, dissociado dos princípios dos cortes perpendiculares aos eixos mecânicos femoral e tibial, o qual foi denominado de alinhamento cinemático , e visa obter perfil articular mais próximo da articulação nativa ao recriar os três eixos cinemáticos do joelho, que são paralelos e perpendiculares às linhas nativas da articulação. Posteriormente, outros conceitos foram introduzidos, como os alinhamentos cinemático invertido, cinemático irrestrito, funcional, e cinemático modificado. 24 25 O que une todas essas novas definições técnicas é a manipulação das tensões e linhas articulares mais “fisiológicas” e potenciais compensações, nos cortes ósseos, de pequenas assimetrias das tensões ligamentares, ou seja: os conceitos outrora estabelecidos por Insall et al. 26 hoje são questionados, se devemos restaurar toda a anatomia e frouxidão ligamentar nativas. As inovações tecnológicas, como a cirurgia assistida por computação (CAC), e as automações favorecerem novas percepções e entendimentos que conduziram a este momento de desenvolvimento conceitual para uma abordagem específica do paciente e são promissoras para que a evolução e desfechos das ATJ sejam otimizadas. É preciso ressaltar que o alinhamento anatômico foi um conceito concebido nos anos 1980 por Krackow, Krena e Hungerford para ser utilizado com a prótese preservando o ligamento cruzado posterior, que acabou no esquecimento, muito por conta de desgaste precoce do tipo de polietileno polido utilizado à época. Com o advento de materiais novos e melhores associado às incorporações de tecnológica assistida por navegação e robótica, a técnica de alinhamento anatômico vem sendo mais bem compreendida e utilizada. 25\n\nÉ preciso mencionar que o conceito de ATJ personalizada não é universalmente aplicável. A doença degenerativa artrítica pode, em muitos pacientes, levar a articulação e o membro a desenvolver deformidades e variações anatômicas e biomecânicas, tais como encurtamento e alongamentos de partes moles e deformidades extra e intra-articulares que dificultam ou inviabilizam a identificação da cinemática fisiológica a ser restabelecida. Além disso, é preciso senso crítico para analisar se a condição anatomomecânica e fisiológica do paciente pode interferir negativamente na longevidade dos implantes. 27 Sendo assim, Vendittoli et al. 2 afirmaram que a ATJ personalizada não significa reproduzir a anatomia do paciente rotineiramente, mas oferecer uma solução cirúrgica de melhor qualidade para abordar a doença com uma tecnologia customizada de implante.\n\nDiante de todas as considerações e conceitos teóricos vantajosos apresentados sobre os implantes customizados, ainda faltam maiores evidências clínicas para demonstrar superioridade dos desfechos com esses tipos de implantes. Müller et al. 28 e Saeed et al. 29 demostraram que as ATJs personalizadas não proporcionaram benefícios superiores aos dos implantes convencionais, e eles observaram maior taxa de revisão precoce entre as customizadas. Já Moret et al. 30 não encontraram diferenças significativas quanto ao desfecho clínico entre os implantes customizados e convencionais. Entretanto, os implantes personalizados se mostraram mais alinhados ao eixo neutro do membro e com melhores ajuste e posicionamento dos implantes.\n\nÉ preciso ressaltar a necessidade de melhores metodologias de pesquisa e desenhos de estudo nas comparações prospectivas entre implantes customizados e convencionais, a fim de clarificar a compreensão dos desfechos da cirurgia personalizada e das técnicas clássicas.\n\n\n## Artroplastia Assistida por Computação (Navegada) e Automação (Robótica)\nNo final dos anos 1970 e início dos anos 1980, os conceitos cirúrgicos e biomecânicos sobre o alinhamento resultante do membro e o equilíbrio ligamentar pós-artroplastia do joelho foram apresentados com maior solidez científica, o que favoreceu o desenvolvimento de implantes melhores e otimizou o desempenho cirúrgico. 26 No começo dos anos 1990, iniciou-se o desenvolvimento da técnica cirúrgica para a ATJ assistida por computação (AC). O princípio dessa tecnologia se baseava na identificação de referências anatômicas intraoperatórias, como os centros da cabeça femoral, do joelho e do tornozelo, para proporcionar visões frontal e lateral em tempo real do eixo mecânico do membro inferior para um melhor controle intraoperatório do eixo do membro do paciente, sendo a primeira ATJ navegada realizada em 21 de janeiro de 1997. 31 Essa tecnologia tem como premissa facilitar a interpretação anatomomecânica do membro do paciente de modo a favorecer as decisões técnicas a serem adotadas pelo cirurgião para definir a melhor estratégia para a cinemática articular e o posicionamento dos implantes.\n\nAs ATJs assistidas por navegação foram evoluindo tecnologicamente e permitiram ao cirurgião identificar, no intraoperatório, muito mais do que o eixo resultante final do membro, uma vez que passaram a permitir a realização com precisão das angulações dos cortes femoral e tibial, o posicionamento rotacional dos componentes femoral e tibial, as dimensões dos espaços de extensão e flexão, e os dimensionamentos dos implantes. A introdução da tecnologia AC associada à ATJ permitiu ao cirurgião ampla compreensão, domínio articular intraoperatório e maior precisão do procedimento em relação ao planejamento, e esse conhecimento contribuiu para o desenvolvimento de novos conceitos mecânicos do alinhamento resultante dos membros. 25 Tais alinhamentos foram flexibilizando os conceitos referentes aos cortes femoral e tibial outrora perpendiculares ao eixo mecânico no alinhamento mecânico convencional. Essa flexibilização permite a estabilidade articular ao diminuir ou evitar liberações de partes moles, ou seja, ao permitir um ajuste de corte ósseo “fino” que compensa pequenos desequilíbrios ligamentares mediante a inclinação da linha articular em relação ao eixo mecânico, se aproximando da anatomia do joelho nativo. 14\n\nAo identificar a possibilidade de se aumentar a precisão cirúrgica da ATJ AC quanto aos cortes ósseos, a cirurgia ortopédica robótica, nos últimos anos, passou por relevante desenvolvimento, e conseguiu aumentar a qualidade e a praticidade do procedimento. 32\n\nA ATJ robótica (ATJr) usa um programa de computador para converter os registros anatômicos do paciente em uma reconstrução tridimensional da articulação do joelho, o que permite que o cirurgião planeje e execute a cirurgia com precisão quanto aos cortes definindos. Portanto, a ATJr é uma técnica cirúrgica que combina navegação AC e auxílio da automação robótica para o posicionamento e/ou realizações dos cortes. 14 32 33 34 A ATJr pode ser dividida em dois subgrupos: a ATJr ativa (autônoma), em que a automação é completa e independe da atuação do cirurgião para a realização dos cortes femorais e tibial planejados; e o sistema robótico semiativo (semiautônomo), mais difundido globalmente e presente no Brasil neste momento, no qual o cirurgião mantém o controle geral sobre a ressecção óssea assistido pela precisão da automação por meio do posicionamento dos guias de cortes ósseos ou de um braço robótico que auxilia a controlar a força, a amplitude de alcance e a direção da lâmina de serra dentro dos limites programados. 34\n\nPode-se afirmar, de maneira resumida e sucinta, que a principal diferença conceitual entre uma ATJ AC e uma ATJr jaz no fato de a primeira ser um procedimento em que o cirurgião posiciona os guias e realiza os cortes assistido por monitoramento computacional. E a ATJr é uma ATJ AC com o auxílio da automação para o posicionamento dos guias de cortes e/ou a realização dos cortes ósseos. O principal benefício da ATJr é o corte ósseo preciso e reprodutível devido a uma interface robótica, independentemente do sistema usado. Além disso, ela permite a mensuração dos gaps de acordo com o planejamento dos cortes ósseos e o posicionamento do implante durante a cirurgia. 4 A precisão dos cortes ósseos conforme planejados é o principal benefício da ATJr, o que contribui para o posicionamento ideal dos implantes e o equilíbrio articular pela mensuração exata dos espaços de flexão e extensão.\n\nNão existem indicações e contraindicações absolutas para a realização da ATJr ou da ATJ AC. No entanto, essas tecnologias se destacam e apresentam vantagens em relação a técnica convencional nos casos de pacientes que apresentam deformidades ósseas diafisárias e hastes intramedulares, condições que dificultam a realização da cirurgia pela técnica convencional.\n\nPacientes com deformidades articulares e falhas ósseas também podem ser favorecidos pelo uso da navegação, uma vez que essa tecnologia permite ao cirurgião visualizar as múltiplas possibilidades de de cortes e dimensionamentos dos implantes durante o planejamento e o intraoperatório.\n\nAlguns sistemas de automação dependem de exame radiográfico pré-operatório para o programa de computador interpretar a reconstrução tridimensional articular que será conciliada com os pontos anatômicos identificados pelo cirurgião. No entanto, é possível, a depender do sistema AC robótico, que a cirurgia seja realizada sem a obrigatoriedade do mapeamento radiológico prévio, o que permite que todas as referências anatômicas e a identificação espacial do joelho e do membro inferior sejam capturadas integralmente durante o ato cirúrgico.\n\nDestaca-se que a ATJ AC permite, com precisão, o controle crítico de muitos conceitos e elementos técnicos relevantes para o comportamento funcional do joelho, a fim de proporcionar previsibilidade mecânica e cinemática ao membro operado antes e após os cortes ósseos, a saber:\n\na inclinação ( slope ) sagital posterior da tíbia na formação do espaço de flexão;\n\no grau de rotação do componente femoral aplicável para a equalização do espaço de flexão entre os compartimentos femorotibiais medial e lateral, e potencial invasão da cortical femoral anterior ( notching );\n\no dimensionamento e a proporcionalidade entre os espaços de extensão e flexão de acordo com os dimensionamentos do componente femoral e do polietileno tibial;\n\no tamanho do componente femoral e sua relação com o dimensionamento do espaço de flexão;\n\no posicionamento do implante femoral no plano sagital;\n\na capacidade de intercambiar os implantes femoral e tibial;\n\na angulação resultante do membro inferior em relação ao eixo mecânico pelos ajustes planejados;\n\na resultante sagital do membro inferior em neutro, recurvo ou flexo;\n\no dimensionamento dos cortes femorais distal e posterior e tibial proximal;\n\na altura da interlinha articular;\n\na equalização entre os espaços de flexão e extensão; e\n\no dimensionamento do polietileno.\n\nA literatura 35 36 37 38 apresenta resultados favoráveis e promissores quanto à capacidade de essa tecnologia proporcionar maior precisão dos componentes, proteção dos tecidos moles, maior satisfação do paciente, uma curva de aprendizado curta, desenho ergonômico ideal e menos fadiga do cirurgião e da equipe cirúrgica. Outros estudos demonstram resultados clínicos semelhantes aos das técnicas convencionais. Onggo et al., 32 em uma revisão sistemática que analisou mais de 6 mil pacientes, concluíram que tanto a ATJr quanto a cirurgia convencional são confiáveis, seguras, e resultam em bons desfechos, ainda que o alinhamento final do membro seja mais preciso nas robóticas. Em uma revisão, Mancino et al. 39 encontraram vantagem para o grupo de ATJr em termos de resultados funcionais iniciais e linhas de radiolucências em comparação ao grupo submetido ao procedimento convencional. Nenhuma diferença significativa entre os dois grupos foi relatada quanto à sobrevivência geral, à taxa de revisão e ao tempo cirúrgico. Em uma revisão sistemática com metanálise de 12 ensaios clínicos randomizados com mais de 2 mil pacientes analisados, Ruangsomboon et al. 40 concluíram que, apesar de a ATJr provavelmente resultar em maior precisão radiológica do que o procedimento convencional, este desfecho pode não ser clinicamente significativo.\n\nEm uma revisão sistemática recente, Nogalo et al. 41 analisaram os relatos das complicações relacionadas às artroplastias robóticas. As principais complicações observadas foram fraturas metafisárias nos orifícios de fixação dos pinos dos refletores da navegação, com ∼ 1,4% delas ocorrendo próximo da décima segunda semana de pós-operatório. A infecção no local dos pinos de reflexões e em incisões acessórias também é descrita, com incidência de 0,47%. 42 É preciso ressaltar que a cirurgia robótica é segura. No entanto, complicações podem acontecer, sendo mais relacionadas à técnica cirúrgica aplicada pelo cirurgião do que por consequência direta da tecnologia empregada. 43\n\n\n## Considerações Finais\nDiante das considerações abordadas neste estudo referente aos propósitos da incorporação de novas tecnologias, assim como novos conceitos técnicos referentes à ATJ, percebe-se, no momento, que os avanços são promissores, ainda que haja a necessidade de estudos com metodologias de maior qualidade e com seguimentos mais longos, a fim de compreendermos as vantagens técnicas de médio e longo prazos quanto aos desfechos clínicos e, por consequência, permitir o desenvolvimento de técnicas e práticas melhores associadas a artroplastias de joelho.\n\n"

Even though its clinical outcomes are mostly favorable, it is estimated that approximately 10% of the patients remain dissatisfied with the procedure. 1 2\n\nGiven the growing demand for TKA and its increasing performance on young adult patients, 3 there is a clear need and search for higher-quality surgical outcomes aiming at implant longevity, a more physiological perception of the joint, better lower limb functionality, and less surgical trauma. 4\n\nIn this context, new technological advances, such as specific instrumentation, guides, and computer-assisted (navigated) and/or automated (robotic) surgery, seek better customization. Moreover, these advances consider the physiology and balance of each patient's ligaments to improve three-dimensional surgical planning, increasing the accuracy of alignment and implant positioning. 4\n\nThese concepts are being presented and introduced into the arthroplasty care market to improve the mechanical understanding of the lower limb, the articular and functional mapping of the knee, and the precision and surgical reliability to increase patient satisfaction. However, since the incorporation of new technologies usually increases costs, surgeons need to understand TKA innovations to develop a critical sense about their practices and visualize the proper use of these new tools to improve surgical outcomes. 5 6\n\nThe present article aims to describe the new technologies in TKA, which involve navigation, robotics, and customized implants, as well as to discuss their current concepts, advantages, and limitations, to help the reader identify how they may contribute to technical development and improve TKA outcomes.\n\n\n## Customized Implants\nThe first devices for knee arthroplasty were introduced in the 1970s. Since then, they have undergone several changes, including surgical technique and implant design. 7 An implant is based on the anatomical dimensional parameters of a defined population group, which may lead to inadequacies in the fit of prosthetic components to the joint anatomy in other populations. Studies involving non-Caucasian populations, such as Indians, Chinese, Malaysians, and Koreans, for example, 8 9 10 11 12 have demonstrated diverse anthropometric relationships that differ from those presented by Caucasians. The comparison of these populations showed significant discrepancies in commercial prosthesis models, which can have a direct effect on arthroplasty outcomes. 8 9 10 11 12 Anatomy can vary with gender, ethnicity, biotype, and acquired phenotypic alterations.\n\nTechnological development promotes more “personalized” orthopedic therapies focused on the specific conditions of each subject. Although a contemporary trend, therapeutic individualization dates to Hippocrates, who said, “It is more important to know what sort of person has a disease than to know what sort of disease a person has.” 13\n\nIndividualized medicine is increasingly present in arthroplasty to obtain better outcomes. Personalized TKA is encouraged by four main pillars: 1) a mechanical axis better adapted to individual biomechanics 14 15 2) anatomical variations that do not fit into predefined implant formats due to joint phenotypic variability; 3) technological evolution enabling better knowledge and intraoperative biomechanical assessment; and 4) commercial pressure from manufacturers to mass-market their new products. 16\n\nCustomized components with physiological coating respect geometry and bone limits, avoiding anatomical hyper- or hypodimensioning and reducing the chances of impacts and friction in soft tissues or lack of adequate joint coverage, resulting in more physiological kinematics. However, even when advocating for individualized anatomophysiological joint restoration, it is necessary to reflect that, at times, the natural biomechanics of a given patient may be a causal or risk factor for joint pain and dysfunction.\n\nCustomized implants enable personalized definitions of the trochlear groove, favoring patellofemoral kinematics regardless of femoral condylar shapes, which can be manufactured with individual curvature radii. This customization enhances the kinematic benefit of the implant and may contribute to reducing the need for compensation to modify femoral rotation and balance the flexion gap. This condition depends on the absence of ligamentous tension asymmetries requiring soft tissue release to reestablish gap balance. 17 18 19 The physiological and anatomical reestablishment of the posterior condylar curvature increases the flexion and extension gaps. It is worth highlighting the influence of the femoral condylar curvature radius, as its relationship with the posterior capsule also interferes with the dimensioning of the extension gap, a condition the surgeon must keep in mind when dimensioning the offset during arthroplasty planning in patients with flexed or hyperextended knees. 20 21 For a physiological arthroplasty, in which the patient does not perceive their “artificial” knee in daily routines, a specific questionnaire has been developed to measure this outcome. 22\n\nConceptually, customized TKA should maintain or seek to restore: 1) the perception of a normal joint; 2) “functional” biomechanics (when the native anatomy is not deemed pathological), namely: a) native kinematic axes; b) native orientation of the joint line; c) native tension of soft tissues; and d) native joint kinematics and kinetics during daily activities; 3) adequate mechanical stress transfer between interfaces; 4) native articular range of motion; 5) macro- and microstability of the joint; 6) polyethylene resistance to wear and solid implant fixation, contributing to its survival without activity restriction; and 7) provide fast and complication-free recovery. 2\n\nCustomized implants gave rise to new conceptual challenges to the TKA classic technical principles, which are binary between the measured resection and the gap-balancing techniques. 23 As such, Lee et al. 24 proposed a new concept dissociated from the principles of sections perpendicular to the femoral and tibial mechanical axes and called it kinematic alignment ; it aims to obtain a joint profile closer to that of the native joint by recreating the three kinematic axes of the knee, which are parallel and perpendicular to the native articular lines. Later, other concepts were introduced, including the inverted kinematic alignment, unrestricted kinematic alignment, functional alignment, and modified kinematic alignment. 24 25 All of these new technical definitions share the manipulation of more “physiological” joint tensions and lines and potential bone section compensations for small asymmetries in ligament tensions. In other words, we now question the concepts previously established by Insall et al. 26 as to whether to restore all native anatomy and ligament laxity. Technological innovations, such as computer-assisted surgery (CAS) and automation, have favored new perceptions and understandings, leading to the current conceptual development for a patient-specific approach, and are promising for optimizing TKA evolution and outcomes. It is worth emphasizing that Krackow, Krena, and Hungerford conceived the concept of anatomical alignment in the 1980s for use with prosthesis preserving the posterior cruciate ligament. This concept was forgotten, largely due to the premature wear of the polished polyethylene used at the time. The advent of new and better materials and the incorporation of navigation-assisted technology and robotics have resulted in a better understanding and use of the anatomical alignment technique. 25\n\nWe must mention that the customized TKA concept does not have universal application. In many patients, degenerative arthritic disease can lead to joint and limb deformities and anatomical and biomechanical variations, such as shortening and lengthening of soft tissues and extra- and intraarticular deformities that make it difficult or impossible to identify physiological kinematics to be restored. In addition, analyzing whether the patient's anatomical and physiological mechanical condition can negatively interfere with the implant's longevity requires critical judgment. 27 Therefore, Vendittoli et al. 2 stated that customized TKA does not mean reproducing the patient's anatomy routinely, but offers a more qualified surgical solution to address the disease with a personalized implant technology.\n\nGiven all the considerations and advantageous theoretical concepts on customized implants, we still need further clinical evidence to demonstrate superior outcomes of these implants. Müller et al. 28 and Saeed et al. 29 demonstrated that customized TKA did not yield benefits superior to those of conventional implants, and they found a higher early revision rate among personalized implants. Moret et al. 30 did not find significant differences in clinical outcomes between customized and conventional implants. However, personalized implants presented better alignment to the neutral axis of the limb, with better adjustment and positioning.\n\nIt is worth emphasizing the need for better research methodologies and study designs in prospective comparisons between personalized and conventional implants to clarify the understanding of the outcomes of customized and classic surgical techniques.\n\n\n## Computer-Assisted (Navigated) and Automated (Robotic) Arthroplasty\nIn the late 1970s and early 1980s, surgical and biomechanical concepts on resulting limb alignment and ligament balancing after knee arthroplasty showed greater scientific solidity, favoring the development of better implants and optimizing surgical performance. 26 The early 1990s witnessed the development of the surgical technique for computer-assisted (CA)-TKA. The principle of this technology is the identification of intraoperative anatomical references, such as the centers of the femoral head, of the knee, and of the ankle, providing real-time frontal and lateral views of the mechanical axis of the lower limb for better intraoperative control of the patient's limb axis. The first navigated TKA was performed on January 21, 1997. 31 This technology aims to facilitate the anatomomechanical interpretation of the patient's limb, favoring the technical decisions taken by the surgeon to define the best strategy for joint kinematics and implant positioning.\n\nNavigation-assisted TKAs have evolved technologically and have enabled the surgeon to intraoperatively identify much more than the final resulting limb axis, as they now enable the precise angulation of the femoral and tibial sections, the rotational positioning of the femoral and tibial components, the dimensions of the extension and flexion gaps, and the sizing of the implants. The introduction of CA technology into TKA has enable surgeons to have a broader understanding, better intraoperative joint control, and greater procedural accuracy in planning; this knowledge has contributed to the development of new mechanical concepts of the resulting limb alignment. 25 As such, the concepts of femoral and tibial sections, previously perpendicular to the mechanical axis in conventional mechanical alignment, became more flexible. This flexibility enables joint stability by reducing or avoiding soft tissue releases, that is, enabling a “thin” bone section adjustment compensating for small ligament imbalances through the inclination of the joint line about the mechanical axis, being closer to the anatomy of the native knee. 14\n\nIdentifying the potential to increase the accuracy of CA-TKA with surgical precision to perform bone sections, robotic orthopedic surgery has undergone significant development in recent years. In addition, it has managed to increase the quality and practicality of the procedure. 32\n\nRobotic TKA (rTKA) uses software to convert the patient's anatomical records into a three-dimensional knee joint reconstruction, enabling the surgeon to plan the procedure and perform the sections precisely. Therefore, rTKA is a surgical technique uniting CA navigation and robotic automation assistance for the positioning and/or performance of the sections. 14 32 33 34 There are two rTKA subgroups: active (autonomous) rTKA, in which automation is complete and independent of the surgeon's action to perform the planned femoral and tibial sections, and semiactive (semiautonomous) robotic system, which is more widespread globally and currently available in Brazil, in which the surgeon has the overall control of bone resection assisted by the precision of automation through the positioning of bone-cutting guides or by a robotic arm helping the surgeon control the force, range of reach, and direction of the saw blade within programmed limits. 34\n\nIn a summarized and succinct manner, the main conceptual difference between CA-TKA and rTKA is that the former is a procedure in which the surgeon positions the guides and performs the sections assisted by computer monitoring. And rTKA is a CA-TKA assisted by automation regarding the positioning of cutting guides and/or the performance of the bone sections. The main benefit of rTKA is the precise and reproducible bone sections due to a robotic interface, regardless of the system. In addition, it enables the measurement of gaps according to the planning of the bone sections and the implant positioning during surgery. 4 The main advantages of rTKA are the accuracy of bone sections as planned, contributing to the ideal implant positioning and joint balance by the exact measurement of the flexion and extension gaps.\n\nThere are no absolute indications or contraindications for rTKA or CA-TKA. Nonetheless, these technologies stand out and have an advantage over the conventional technique in patients with diaphyseal bone deformities and intramedullary rods, which hinder the classic surgery.\n\nPatients with joint deformities and bone defects can also benefit from navigation, as this technology enables the surgeon to visualize the multiple possibilities of sections and implant sizing during planning and intraoperatively.\n\nSome automation systems depend on preoperative radiographic examination for the software to interpret the three-dimensional joint reconstruction that will match the anatomical points identified by the surgeon. However, depending on the robotic CA system, the surgery may not require prior radiological mapping, enabling the capture of all anatomical references and spatial identification of the knee and lower limb during the procedure.\n\nIt is worth noting that CA-TKA enables precise critical control of many concepts and technical elements relevant to the functional behavior of the knee to promote mechanical and kinematic predictability to the operated limb before and after bone sections, including:\n\nThe posterior sagittal tibial slope to form the flexion gap;\n\nThe degree of rotation of the femoral component to equalize the flexion gap between the medial and lateral femorotibial compartments and potential notching of the anterior femoral cortex;\n\nThe dimensioning and proportionality between the extension and flexion gaps according to the dimensions of the femoral component and the tibial polyethylene;\n\nThe size of the femoral component and its relationship with the dimensioning of the flexion gap;\n\nThe positioning of the femoral implant in the sagittal plane;\n\nThe ability to interchange the femoral and tibial implants;\n\nThe resulting angulation of the lower limb about the mechanical axis per planned adjustments;\n\nThe resulting sagittal of the lower limb in neutral, recurved, or flexed positions;\n\nThe dimensioning of the distal and posterior femoral and proximal tibial sections;\n\nThe height of the joint interline;\n\nThe equalization of the flexion and extension gaps; and\n\nPolyethylene dimensioning.\n\nThe literature 35 36 37 38 presents favorable and promising outcomes regarding the ability of this technology to result in greater precision of the components, soft tissue protection, greater patient satisfaction, short learning curve, ideal ergonomic design, and lower levels of fatigue for the surgeon and surgical team. Other studies have demonstrated clinical outcomes similar to those of the conventional techniques. In a systematic review analyzing more than 6 thousand patients, Onggo et al. 32 concluded that rTKA and conventional TKA are reliable, safe, and yield good outcomes, even though the final limb alignment is more accurate with robotics. A review by Mancino et al. 39 found an advantage for the rTKA group in terms of the initial functional outcomes and radiolucency lines compared to the group submitted to the conventional procedure. They reported no significant differences between the two groups in terms of overall survival, revision rate, and operative time. In their systematic review and meta-analysis of 12 randomized clinical studies involving more than 2 thousand patients, Ruangsomboon et al. 40 concluded that, although rTKA probably results in better radiological accuracy than the conventional technique, this outcome may not have clinical significance.\n\nA recent systematic review by Nogalo et al. 41 explored complications in robotic arthroplasties. The main complications observed were metaphyseal fractures in the fixation holes of the navigation reflector pins, with ∼ 1.4% occurring around the twelfth postoperative week. The incidence rate of infection at the reflection pin and accessory incision sites was of 0.47%. 42 It is worth emphasizing that robotic surgery is safe. Nonetheless, complications may occur and are more related to the surgical technique than a direct consequence of the technology. 43\n\n\n## Final Considerations\nGiven the considerations addressed in the current study regarding the purposes of incorporating new technologies and technical concepts into TKA, the advances are promising. Still, further studies with higher-quality methodologies and longer follow-up periods are required to understand the medium and long-term technical advantages regarding the clinical outcomes and, consequently, to enable the development of better techniques and practices for knee arthroplasties.\n\n"

É um procedimento em crescimento mundial 1 2 e, ao mesmo tempo que as ATJ primárias aumentam, as taxas de revisões de artroplastias também acompanham o crescimento. Nos Estados Unidos, as revisões de ATJ correspondem a ∼ 10% dos números de artroplastias primárias. 1\n\nRevisões de ATJ são cirurgias desafiadoras para os cirurgiões devido à complexidade provocada pela perda óssea associada às insuficiências ligamentares. Uma dificuldade primária é a determinação da altura da linha articular (LA) diante das perdas ósseas existentes. Restaurar o posicionamento da LA fisiológica é um dos princípios importantes na ATJ de revisão para melhorar a amplitude de movimento, otimizar o funcionamento do mecanismo extensor e manter a cinemática normal do joelho. 3\n\nMuitos autores estudaram métodos estimados para definir a LA utilizando marcadores anatômicos como a cabeça da fíbula, a tuberosidade tibial e as distâncias epicondilares. 3 4 É preciso destacar que estudos em determinados grupos populacionais podem divergir em seus aspectos anatômicos do joelho de outros grupos étnicos. 5 6 7\n\nNeste contexto, o objetivo do presente estudo foi analisar uma razão constante entre os marcadores anatômicos do joelho: distância do epicôndilo medial clínico (DEM), distância do epicôndilo lateral (DEL) e eixo bicortical condilar (EBC) para facilitar o cirurgião a estimar o posicionamento da linha articular em procedimentos de revisões de ATJ na população brasileira.\n\n\n## Materiais e Métodos\nO presente estudo foi aprovado pelo comitê de ética da Universidade Federal de São Paulo sob o número CAAE-83009724.5.0000.5505. Foram selecionados de maneira aleatória e anônima 500 exames de ressonância magnética (RM) de joelhos de 250 mulheres e 250 homens.\n\nO critério de inclusão foi pacientes de ambos os sexos esqueleticamente maduros.\n\nOs critérios de exclusão foram exames com deformidade morfológica óssea do joelho (osteófitos), exames com dispositivos médicos implantáveis e evidência de fratura articular prévia.\n\nOs pacientes elegíveis foram identificados no banco de imagens de RM da instituição disponíveis em sua plataforma e no software Clinical Collaboration Platform (Carestream Health). No caso de pacientes com exames bilaterais, foi incluído para análise apenas o joelho direito.\n\nAs mensurações das DEM e DEL da linha articular femoral foram avaliadas em cortes coronais em sequência T2 e a distância do EBC foi mensurada em cortes axiais em sequência T2 de RMs no próprio software e mensuradas em milímetros (mm):\n\nDistância do EBC: a 15mm anterior à linha articular posterior à distância do eixo bicortical mediolateral femoral foi avaliada no nível do aparecimento dos dois epicôndilos femorais no corte axial de RM ( Fig. 1.1 ).\n\nDEM femoral: distância do ponto mais proximal e proeminente da crista do epicôndilo medial clínico até o ponto articular distal do côndilo femoral medial observado no corte coronal de RM ( Fig. 1.2 ).\n\nDEL femoral: distância do ponto mais proximal e proeminente do epicôndilo lateral da crista epicondilar até o ponto articular distal do côndilo femoral lateral observado no corte coronal de RM ( Fig. 1.3 ).\n\nA Fig. 1.1 expressa a mensuração da distância do eixo bicortical condilar; a Fig. 1.2 demonstra a distância epicondilar medial à linha articular e a Fig.1.3 demonstra a distância epicondilar lateral à linha articular.\n\nTodas as mensurações foram realizadas por um único cirurgião de joelho duas vezes e em dias diferentes. Foram computadas somente as mensurações que apresentaram variação < 10% na análise intraobservador.\n\nAs avaliações epidemiológicas como idade, sexo e distâncias morfológicas ósseas obtidas foram submetidas a análise estatística de média e desvio padrão (DP).\n\nA metodologia de amostra e os cálculos das amostras foram determinados para um intervalo de confiança (IC) de 95%.\n\nPara cada um dos 500 pares de valores da DEL versus EBC e DEM versus EBC, foram calculadas razões para o sexo masculino e feminino separadamente:\n\n\n## Resultados\nA média etária dos pacientes analisados foi de 50,91 ± 14,76 anos. A média de idade para o sexo masculino foi de 48,82 ± 15,43 anos e 53,01 ± 13,73 anos para o sexo feminino. A média de distância do EBC foi 72,11 ± 5,93mm, sendo 76,21 ± 4,83mm para os homens e 68,00 ± 3,64mm e para as mulheres. As DEM e DEL médias foram 33,39 ± 3,50mm e 26,32 ± 4,08mm, sendo para o sexo masculino de 35,20 ± 3,15mm e 27,11 ± 4,60mm e para o sexo feminino 31,58 ± 2,86mm e 25,53 ± 3,25mm ( Tabela 1 ).\n\nAbreviações : DEL, distância epicôndilo lateral à linha articular; DEM, distância epicôndilo medial à linha articular; DP, desvio padrão; EBC, eixo bicortical condilar.\n\nA razão obtida no sexo feminino para o epicôndilo lateral foi de IC95% = 0,3720–0,3815 com margem de erro de ± 0,0048; já a razão obtida para o epicôndilo medial foi de IC95% = 0,4599–0,4707, com margem de erro de ± 0,0054. A razão obtida no sexo masculino para o epicôndilo lateral foi de IC95% = 0,3559–0,3671, com margem de erro de ± 0,0056, e para o epicôndilo medial foi de IC95% = 0,4568–0,4668, com margem de erro de ± 0,0050. Neste cenário, há evidências de que a verdadeira razão entre o epicôndilo lateral ou medial e a distância EBC está, com 95% de confiança, nos intervalos supracitados.\n\nDesta forma, foram estabelecidas as seguintes fórmulas para o determinar a linha articular em relação aos EBC, DEM e DEL:\n\n\n## Discussão\nA relação das referências anatômicas epicondilares e distância biepicondilar do joelho como potencial de serem utilizadas na parametrização e determinação do posicionamento da linha articular femoral se apresentou satisfatória em joelhos da população brasileira com razões métricas adequadas em ambos os sexos.\n\nEm procedimentos de ATJ de revisão, a manutenção da altura articular é uma condição fundamental para preservação da funcionalidade biomecânica do joelho no pós-operatório, de forma a garantir, com êxito, uma boa mobilidade e estabilidade articular do paciente. No entanto, as dificuldades técnicas para determinar esta referência anatômica é relevante devido às perdas ósseas. Quando o posicionamento da linha articular é sacrificado cirurgicamente, há um maior risco de comprometimento biomecânico articular e este fato está associado a desgaste, sobrecarga e instabilidade patelar seja por frouxidão ligamentar ou tensão excessiva, 8 9 10 sendo que a modificação de posicionamento da LA em 8mm está associada a alterações funcionais significativas e com piores desfechos clínicos de seguimento pós-operatório. 11 12\n\nNeste sentido, foram descritos estudos que se propuseram a investigar a relação entre a linha articular e estruturas anatômicas como referência, a fim de estabelecer parâmetros intraoperatórios para se identificar a LA com os epicôndilos laterais e mediais, estruturas destacadas e fundamentais para tal propósito, demonstrando uma boa e precisa relação entre tais marcações anatômicas para esta finalidade. 3 4 Contudo, não identificamos estudos na literatura que buscaram estabelecer estes parâmetros específicos para a população brasileira.\n\nRessalta-se que diversas populações mundiais, como caucasianos, estado-unidenses, asiáticos e europeus têm apresentado resultados variáveis para os aspectos morfológicos dos joelhos, demonstrando que as características anatômicas podem divergir em algum grau das relações anatômicas de diversas populações étnicas, 6 13 14 15 16 e por estes achados é fundamental que populações miscigenadas, como a brasileira, tenha seus parâmetros articulares analisados para aumentar a confiança dos dados morfológicos articulares. A importância da realização de estudos em populações específicas se pauta na diversidade étnica mundial e em suas potenciais influências em características anatômicas populacionais. Desta forma, o presente estudo atribui aos cirurgiões brasileiros uma alternativa de aprimoramento de posicionamento do componente femoral, principalmente nas ATJ de revisão, a fim de contribuir com mais um potencial parâmetro de acurácia para se estimar a LA.\n\nNo presente estudo, optou-se por avaliar a relação do posicionamento da LA baseado em parâmetros anatômicos evidentes – epicôndilos durante uma ATJ de revisão em imagens de RM devido à maior facilidade para a identificação anatômica destes e mensurações das distâncias epicondilares se comparado a radiografias simples. A distância bicondilar é facilmente observada durante a cirurgia, ainda que os pontos proeminentes dos epicôndilos possam proporcionar alguma dificuldade de identificação acurada, ainda assim possível de se mapear intraoperatoriamente.\n\nOs resultados encontrados demonstraram que é possível aplicar um multiplicador constante às distâncias EBC durante a cirurgia de ATJ com perdas ósseas a fim de se estimar, através dos epicôndilos mediais e ou laterais, o posicionamento da LA com IC95%, agregando maior acurácia e segurança ao cirurgião quando analisada a população brasileira. Observou-se que, em média, a DEM se apresentou mais proximal à DEL em 27% para o sexo masculino e em 23% para o sexo feminino. A existência de dois parâmetros de estimativa da LA baseado nos epicôndilos pode aumentar a acurácia cirúrgica para esta determinação, já que, a depender das características anatômicas de cada paciente e das dificuldades de acesso articular imputada pelas vias de acesso cirúrgicas, é possível que um determinado epicôndilo seja mais factível para identificação do que o outro.\n\nA obtenção da posição da LA a partir do epicôndilo medial é um fato bem estudado e sedimentado na literatura vigente e sugere distâncias fixas entre 23mm e 35mm, dependendo das relações biotípicas dos pacientes. 3 4 17 Outros autores avaliaram o posicionamento da LA a partir da cabeça da fíbula e encontraram relação de 4mm a 22mm, sendo demonstrado que o parâmetro de menor variabilidade é a referência epicondilar quando comparada à cabeça da fíbula para a mesma finalidade. 3 4 18 19 Rajagopal et al. 8 estudaram a relação de proporcionalidade entre a distância interepicondilar e os epicôndilos até a superfície articular, que se demonstrou constante na população inglesa, concluindo que esta medida pode ser usada para prever a posição da altura da linha articular.\n\nOs resultados do presente estudo possuem limitações e devem ser analisados com senso crítico pelo leitor. Não foram analisados os perfis biométricos de altura e peso dos pacientes a fim de compreender se as divergências anatômicas da população podem estar relacionadas a outras características biotípicas. Não foram analisados os perfis de miscigenação das amostras para determinar se os grupos estudados poderiam ter vieses de raça ou cor. Os cortes ósseos parametrizados no estudo radiológico podem não corresponder aos realizados por um cirurgião a depender das condições cirúrgicas, tais como hipoplasias ou defeitos ósseos, fato que poderia agregar viés de transposição dos resultados encontrados para estes casos.\n\n\n## Conclusão\nA distância do eixo bicortical condilar femoral pode ser usado como referência para a determinação do posicionamento da LA a partir das distâncias dos epicôndilos femorais medial e lateral.\n\n"

Search terms included combinations of “knee dislocation,” “multiligament knee injury,” “low-resource settings,” “developing countries,” “vascular injury,” “implantless fixation,” and “cost-effective orthopedics.”\n\nStudies were eligible for inclusion if they focused on the evaluation, diagnosis, surgical treatment, or rehabilitation of knee dislocations in adult populations, particularly in low- or middle-income countries or resource-limited environments. Both traumatic and spontaneous knee dislocations were considered, but the emphasis was placed on high-energy trauma and multiligament injuries.\n\nEligible articles included clinical trials, observational studies, systematic and narrative reviews, case series, case reports, expert consensus documents, and global surveys. Articles not available in English, studies focused exclusively on pediatric or oncologic populations, and those unrelated to constrained-resource environments were excluded.\n\nThe literature was critically reviewed to extract practical strategies and evidence applicable to underserved contexts. The authors' clinical experience in low-income public healthcare systems also informed the interpretation and selection of relevant content.\n\n\n## Epidemiology and Global Burden\nKnee dislocations are relatively rare injuries, accounting for less than 0.02% of all orthopaedic trauma admissions in high-income countries. However, in low- and middle-income settings, the true incidence may be markedly underestimated due to underreporting, limited diagnostic capabilities, and variations in trauma registries. 6 , 7\n\nIn high-resource regions, sports-related trauma is the predominant cause of knee dislocations, often presenting as low- to moderate-energy injuries with isolated ligamentous compromise. By contrast, in low-income countries, most knee dislocations result from high-energy mechanisms such as motorcycle accidents, pedestrian-vehicle collisions, or falls from height—particularly in densely populated urban centers. 2 , 3 These injuries typically involve extensive multiligament disruption and a higher risk of associated vascular and neurologic compromise.\n\nA study by Venter et al, 4 based on a global survey of orthopaedic surgeons, highlighted that delayed diagnosis and treatment are more prevalent in low-resource settings, often due to a lack of access to emergent imaging and specialist care. In addition, Spiegel et al 5 emphasized the burden of musculoskeletal trauma in low-income countries as a leading contributor to long-term disability among working-age adults.\n\nRisk factors for knee dislocation in these environments include high rates of road traffic accidents, poor enforcement of safety regulations (eg, helmet and seat belt use), limited emergency transport systems, and delayed hospital presentation. These factors not only influence the severity of injury but also affect the timing and quality of treatment. 7 - 9\n\nAddressing the global burden of knee dislocations requires a context-sensitive understanding of these epidemiologic patterns to guide prevention, early recognition, and resource-appropriate management strategies.\n\n\n## Initial Evaluation and Diagnosis in Resource-limited Settings\nThe initial evaluation of a suspected knee dislocation must begin with a thorough clinical assessment, given the high risk of associated vascular and neurologic injuries. In resource-constrained settings, where access to advanced imaging may be delayed or unavailable, clinical vigilance and systematic examination are essential.\n\nA visibly deformed, unstable, or shortened limb should raise immediate suspicion for dislocation, even in cases where spontaneous reduction has occurred before evaluation. Palpation of distal pulses—particularly the dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial arteries—is mandatory and should be compared with the contralateral limb. Capillary refill, skin temperature, and limb color provide additional clues to vascular status. The ankle-brachial index (ABI) remains a low-cost, reliable tool: Values <0.9 suggest potential arterial injury and warrant additional vascular investigation. 1 , 10\n\nNeurologic assessment should include motor and sensory testing of the peroneal and tibial nerves, with special attention to foot dorsiflexion and plantarflexion, as well as light touch sensation over the dorsum and sole of the foot. Ultrasound may also be employed to characterize the pattern of peroneal nerve injury, thereby aiding surgical planning, especially in cases of complete disruption (neurotmesis). Peroneal nerve palsy, either transient or permanent, is reported in up to 40% of high-energy knee dislocations. 11\n\nIn the absence of overt ischemia, Doppler ultrasonography is a valuable first-line tool in low-resource environments. It is portable, widely available, and allows dynamic assessment of arterial flow. If Doppler findings are abnormal or inconclusive, CT angiography (CTA) is preferred—when available—due to its high sensitivity and specificity. 12 Plain radiographs (anterior-posterior and lateral) are essential to confirm joint alignment, assess for fractures, and exclude spontaneous relocation. When accessible, point-of-care ultrasonography can also assist in identifying hemarthrosis or posterior capsule disruptions. 13\n\nThe challenge in these settings is to balance urgency with pragmatism: Clinical judgment must drive decision-making when technology is lacking. Early recognition and documentation of vascular and neurologic status are crucial to guide timely referral or intervention.\n\n\n## Vascular and Neurologic Injury Management\nVascular injury remains the most critical and time-sensitive complication of knee dislocation. The popliteus artery is particularly vulnerable due to its fixation in the adductor hiatus and behind the knee joint. Missed or delayed diagnosis can lead to irreversible ischemia, limb loss, and even mortality. In resource-limited environments, early clinical recognition and streamlined referral protocols are essential to optimize outcomes. 1 , 14\n\nThe initial vascular assessment should include pulse palpation, limb temperature, capillary refill, and measurement of the ABI. ABI values <0.9 after reduction warrant additional investigation. When advanced imaging is unavailable, portable Doppler ultrasonography serves as a reliable tool to detect gross flow abnormalities and should be incorporated into emergency protocols. 10\n\nRevascularization is indicated in cases of absent distal pulses or confirmed arterial transection, preferably within 6 to 8 hours of injury. In settings without in-house vascular surgery, rapid referral to a higher-level center must be prioritized. When available, temporary intraluminal vascular shunts may be used for limb salvage before definitive repair. 15 Simultaneous stabilization with an external fixator can facilitate transport and vascular repair.\n\nNerve injury, particularly peroneal nerve palsy, occurs in up to 40% of high-energy knee dislocations, often presenting with foot drop and sensory loss. In the acute phase, observation is recommended unless there is clear evidence of nerve transection or open injury. If no improvement is observed within two months, surgical decompression should be considered. When a lateral procedure is required for fracture fixation or ligament insufficiency, nerve decompression is mandatory in cases of peroneal nerve palsy without neurotmesis. 16 - 18\n\nProtective bracing treatment (AFO) and early physical therapy are essential to prevent contractures and secondary deformities. Tendon transfer may be considered in cases of persistent deficit after 6 to 12 months, depending on local surgical expertise. 1 , 14\n\nDespite limited tools, timely recognition, serial clinical monitoring, surgical decompression after two months without improvement, and coordinated care pathways can markedly improve neurovascular outcomes in patients with knee dislocations.\n\n\n## Acute Stabilization and Initial Management\nInitial management of knee dislocation begins with prompt recognition and immediate reduction of the dislocated joint. Closed reduction under conscious sedation or local anesthesia should be done as soon as possible, especially in cases with neurovascular compromise. Gentle longitudinal traction followed by directed manipulation usually restores alignment. Postreduction, distal pulses must be reassessed and compared with prereduction status. 11 , 19\n\nTemporary immobilization is recommended after reduction to maintain joint stability and reduce patient discomfort. In resource-limited environments, long leg splints or simple plaster casts may serve as viable options when braces are unavailable. Postreduction radiographs are essential to confirm realignment and identify associated fractures. 20\n\nExternal fixation is indicated in grossly unstable knees—particularly in the setting of vascular injury requiring revascularization, open dislocations, or notable soft-tissue trauma. It provides stability, allows wound access, and facilitates safe transport when transfer to a higher-level center is necessary. In low-resource settings, external fixators are often reusable and may be assembled with basic instrumentation. It is important to remove the external fixator within 4 weeks to minimize the risk of knee stiffness. 2 , 20 , 21\n\nThe optimal timing of ligamentous reconstruction remains controversial, but in constrained environments, surgical planning must adapt to logistical realities. When feasible, early intevention within 10-14 days facilitates better identification of structures, allowing repairs and augmentations (repair combined with reconstruction). At this stage, capsular cicatrization has already occurred, making arthroscopy safer; nonetheless, arthroscopy should preferably be performed without continuous irrigation, with certain steps carried out as a dry procedure to reduce the risk of compartment syndrome. Delayed reconstruction—typically performed 3 to 6 weeks postinjury—is also an option, allowing time for soft-tissue recovery, completion of vascular repair, and availability of surgical resources. In selected cases, where surgical access is unpredictable or delayed treatment is not feasible, early definitive repair may be justified. 21 - 23\n\nUltimately, stabilization strategies in low-income settings require balancing clinical urgency with system limitations. A staged approach—initial reduction and external fixation, followed by delayed ligamentous reconstruction—remains the most pragmatic pathway in most cases.\n\n\n## Surgical Strategies in Low-income Environments\nMLKIs, frequently associated with high-energy trauma, often require complex reconstructive procedures. In low-income settings, however, surgical strategies must be tailored to limited implant availability, reduced operating room time, and lack of advanced instrumentation. A growing body of literature supports pragmatic, evidence-based approaches using autografts, simplified fixation techniques, and reusable or implant-free solutions. 24 , 25\n\nWhen allografts and advanced implants are unavailable, autografts remain the most feasible option. Hamstring tendons (semitendinosus and gracilis) are commonly harvested, but alternative graft sources such as the quadriceps tendon (QT), rectus femoris (RF), and peroneus longus have demonstrated adequate biomechanical properties. 26 - 28\n\nThe QT graft is gaining popularity in multiligament knee reconstructions, especially for the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), 29 , 30 but it remains one of the least used autografts. 31 Biomechanical studies indicate that the QT graft has superior structural properties compared with the bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB) graft, 32 , 33 and a meta-analysis has shown functional outcomes comparable with those of hamstring and BPTB grafts. 34 Furthermore, the QT is a versatile graft that can be harvested in different ways. 35 , 36 Among these techniques, harvesting the superficial layer of the QT—known as the RF graft—has been gaining prominence. 37\n\nThe peroneus longus tendon, in particular, has gained attention due to its sufficient length, easy harvest, and minimal donor site morbidity, especially in cases of hemitendon harvest, where it is split longitudinally and the anterior portion is used as a graft. Studies suggest that it may serve as a viable substitute for hamstring grafts in ACL and multiligament reconstructions. 38\n\nTo reduce surgical time and material use, single femoral tunnel techniques have been developed for combined ligament reconstructions. For example, a shared tunnel can accommodate both posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) and medial collateral ligament (MCL) grafts, or ACL, lateral collateral ligament (LCL), and anterolateral ligament (ALL) structures, minimizing tunnel convergence and preserving bone stock. 2\n\nImplantless fixation techniques—such as press-fit fixation, bone bridges, and cortical suspensory methods using knotless suture loops—eliminate the need for expensive implant. These techniques, when executed correctly, have shown acceptable biomechanical strength in both cadaveric and clinical studies. 39 , 40 Their use is especially valuable in systems without consistent implant supply or sterilization facilities.\n\nIn some low-resource hospitals, sterilized and reused metallic screws and plates have been used because of cost constraints. While controversial, studies from trauma and reconstructive surgery have demonstrated that, with strict protocols for sterilization and visual inspection, reprocessed implants can be safely used in selected cases. 41 , 42 Nonetheless, surgeons must weigh potential legal and infection risks, and this approach should follow institutional policies.\n\nA simplified, resource-conscious technique for acute MLKI reconstruction may include the following steps: Exposure: A single longitudinal incision provides access to medial and central structures. Graft harvest: Ipsilateral hamstrings are harvested. In their absence, peroneus longus or RF may be considered. Tunnel preparation: One femoral tunnel is drilled for both cruciate and collateral structures if applicable. Fixation: Use of press-fit graft ends or suturing over cortical bone bridges to avoid screws or buttons. Staged procedures: When feasible, posterior and lateral structures can be reconstructed later, depending on patient stability, tissue condition, and surgical logistics. Some patients undergoing staged procedures decline ACL reconstruction after initial PCL and collateral ligament reconstruction, as they consider their knees satisfactory - particularly in the setting of partial ACL lesions. This staged, modular approach offers surgeons flexibility while conserving resources and minimizing complications.\n\nExposure: A single longitudinal incision provides access to medial and central structures.\n\nGraft harvest: Ipsilateral hamstrings are harvested.

The peroneus longus tendon and RF are a viable alternative, especially when larger grafts or longer constructs are needed. BPTB is an option that should always be considered for ACL reconstruction. 43\n\nTunnel configuration: Single-bundle reconstructions for both ACL and PCL are recommended in low-resource settings. A shared femoral tunnel, known as the “confluent tunnel” approach, reduces surgical time, avoids tunnel convergence, and minimizes implant requirements. 2 , 44\n\nImplantless techniques: Press-fit femoral fixation and tibial bone bridges can be used when implants are unavailable. These techniques use graft compression against cancellous bone or cortical ridges for mechanical stability. 45 - 47\n\nLow-cost implant techniques: When basic implants are available, the use of a metallic interference screw on the femoral side and a surgical staple (agrafe) on the tibial cortex offers an effective, reproducible, and affordable alternative. 48 , 49\n\nGraft choices: Given the complexity of this combined pattern, thoughtful graft allocation is critical in low-resource settings. Three clinically feasible configurations include\n\nOption 1: Semitendinosus and gracilis tendons (hamstring) or BPTB for ACL, hemiperoneus longus tendon graft for ALL, and RF tendon for PCL reconstruction. 50\n\nOption 2: RF used as a double graft for both ACL and ALL (when of adequate length >24 cm), hamstring tendons for PCL. 37\n\nOption 3: Tripled hamstring graft (semitendinosus + gracilis) in braid configuration for ACL, 51 gracilis for ALL, and RF for PCL.\n\nOption 4: Semitendinosus and gracilis tendons (hamstring) for ACL, lemaire tenodesis for ALL, and RF tendon for PCL reconstruction. 52\n\nA single femoral tunnel for both ACL and ALL can be used, with the graft limbs diverging toward the tibial ACL and ALL insertion sites. This minimizes tunnel convergence and reduces surgical complexity. PCL femoral and tibial tunnels remain independent but can follow simplified trajectories.\n\nImplantless: Bone bridge on the tibial side (ACL), press-fit on the femoral side, and ALL may be sutured directly to periosteum.\n\nA metallic interference screw on the femoral ACL/PCL tunnel, staple (agrafe) for tibial ACL or ALL insertions, suspensory cortical button if available for ACL and ALL on femoral fixation, and BPTB press-fit fixation can be recommended as a fixation technique for ACL reconstruction.\n\nOption 1: Hamstring or BPTB for ACL, hemiperoneus longus tendon graft for LCL, and RF tendon for PCL reconstruction. 50\n\nOption 2: RF used as a double graft for both ACL and LCL (when of adequate length >24 cm) and hamstring tendons for PCL. 37\n\nTunnel configuration: Independent tibial and femoral tunnels. To reduce tunnel crowding, position ACL tunnel more anteriorly.\n\nPress-fit graft ends into femoral sockets\n\nBone bridge tibial anchoring or suture tying over cortical buttons (metal or reused implants)\n\nInterference screws (metallic, nonbiodegradable) in femur and tibia\n\nStaples (agrafes) for LCL or PCL tibial fixation\n\nSuspensory buttons or washers repurposed from trauma sets if available\n\nBPTB press-fit fixation can be recommended as a fixation technique for ACL reconstruction.\n\nA simplified version of the LaPrade anatomic posterolateral corner (PLC) reconstruction can be adapted using a single long autograft passed through the fibular head and fixed in separate femoral tunnels for the LCL and popliteus. 53 This avoids conflict with the ACL tunnel and reduces surgical steps. The ACL can be reconstructed in a standard outside-in fashion and fixed with press-fit, screw, or suture-loop technique depending on graft and resources.\n\nTiming: In settings with limited access to ORs, single-stage reconstruction is recommended.\n\nThis combination is one of the most severe patterns of knee dislocation, resulting in global instability with anterior, posterior, and posterolateral laxity. Management requires coordinated reconstruction of the central axis (ACL and PCL) and the PLC, which, if unaddressed, leads to high failure rates of cruciate reconstructions. Although closely related within the lateral knee anatomy, injuries to the PLC and the LCL are not the same. The LCL is one of the key static stabilizers of the lateral compartment, resisting varus stress. By contrast, the PLC is a broader anatomic complex that includes the LCL, popliteus tendon, and popliteofibular ligament, among other structures. Although an isolated LCL injury results in linear varus instability, a true PLC injury causes combined varus and external rotational instability. Failure to identify and treat a complete PLC injury—beyond just the LCL—can lead to reconstruction failure of both ACL and PCL.\n\nPreferred Graft Choices in Low-resource Settings\n\nHamstring tendons for ACL or PLC, QT, or RF tendon autograft: Preferred for either ACL or PCL due to its robustness, length, and preservation of hamstrings.\n\nHemiperoneal autograft: (Split peroneus longus) ideal for popliteus or PFL components of PLC.\n\nBPTB: When feasible, especially for ACL, allows press-fit fixation without implants.\n\nBiceps femoris tendon (split): Can be used for LCL reconstruction, but may cause lateral instability or morbidity in already damaged PLCs.\n\nPlantaris tendon: Suitable for short graft needs (e.g., PFL), but variable in anatomy and diameter.\n\nACL and PCL: Independent tunnels for tibial and femoral fixation. Careful angulation to avoid tunnel convergence with PLC.\n\nFemoral tunnel shared for LCL and popliteus\n\nFibular tunnel for PFL\n\nAvoid tibial PLC tunnels in low-resource environments.\n\nFixation methods—Implantless/low-cost:\n\nPress-fit fixation in femoral and tibial sockets with BPTB\n\nBone bridges on tibia or fibula\n\nSutures over cortical bone for PFL or LCL anchoring.\n\nInterference screws (nonbiodegradable) for femoral ACL/PCL tunnels\n\nSurgical staples (agrafes) for securing tendons at tibial/fibular ends\n\nReused trauma implant (e.g., washers and buttons).\n\nAnatomic PLC Reconstruction with Autografts—Franciozi et al. 54\n\nDescribes the use of three autografts (gracilis, semitendinosus, and biceps femoris) to reconstruct LCL, popliteus, and PFL in their respective tunnels. Adaptable with\n\nPress-fit or metallic screw fixation\n\nCompatible with RF or hemiperoneal substitutions\n\nStep-by-step guidance for tunnel creation and graft passage.\n\nModified LaPrade Technique—Single-graft Loop\n\nUsing a long autograft passed through the fibular tunnel and fixed into two femoral sockets for LCL and popliteus. Minimizes graft harvesting. 55\n\nOutside-in ACL + PCL Reconstruction + Staged PLC\n\nIdeal for settings where full reconstruction must be staged. Begin with ACL + PCL using BPTB or RF with press-fit. Add PLC later with hamstrings or peroneus longus. 2\n\nTiming: In settings with limited access to ORs, single-stage reconstruction is recommended.\n\nThis tricompartmental injury presents with global coronal instability. While uncommon, it may result from high-energy varus-valgus stress combined with ACL rupture (e.g., motorcycle trauma and sports with twisting impacts). Simultaneous reconstruction of both medial and lateral complexes is technically demanding and must be carefully planned to avoid tunnel convergence and soft-tissue crowding.\n\nACL: Hamstring or BPTB or RF tendon\n\nLCL: Peroneus longus tendon\n\nMCL: Semitendinosus tendon with tibial tunnel, as described by Canuto et al. 56\n\nAlternative: Tibial sling with triangular configuration, including a posterior oblique ligament (POL) limb 57\n\nOthers: Fascia lata, QT (when hamstrings are preserved).\n\nACL: Independent femoral and tibial tunnels\n\nLCL: Femoral and fibular tunnels (PLC must be ruled out before considering isolated LCL)\n\nMCL: Canuto technique: Femoral tunnel + two tibial tunnels (anterior and posterior to pes anserinus). Franciozi technique: Tibial sling from femoral isometric point to a triangular fixation point on tibia + POL reinforcement.\n\nCare must be taken to stagger tunnels and avoid convergence between MCL and ACL on the medial femoral condyle.\n\nImplantless: Press-fit femoral fixation for ACL, bone bridge, or suture loop for tibial MCL attachment\n\nImplants: Metallic screws (nonbiodegradable) and staples (agrafe) for MCL tibial exit\n\nSuspensory fixation for ACL or MCL when adequate soft-tissue coverage is present.\n\nStage 1: ACL + MCL reconstruction if lateral side is stable or braceable\n\nStage 2: LCL or PLC reconstruction after tissue recovery.\n\nIn unstable cases or poor follow-up environments, perform all reconstructions in one stage.\n\nThis combination is relatively more common, especially in valgus-external rotation injuries or contact sports. MCL injuries are often managed nonoperatively; however, high-grade tears (grade III), or persistent instability after ACL reconstruction, require surgical treatment.\n\nACL: Hamstring or BPTB or RF tendon\n\nMCL: Semitendinosus tendon with tibial tunnel, as described by Canuto et al. 56\n\nAlternative: Tibial sling with triangular configuration 57\n\nOthers: Fascia lata, QT (when hamstrings are preserved), and peroneus longus tendon.\n\nACL: Independent femoral and tibial tunnels\n\nMCL: Femoral tunnel at isometric point (posterior and proximal to medial epicondyle). Canuto 56 : Or two tibial tunnels with sutured graft ends. 57\n\nBone bridge and cortical suture loops\n\nScrews and staples when available\n\nIn isolated ACL + MCL lesions:\n\nGrade I–II MCL: Treat nonoperatively, reconstruct only ACL\n\nGrade III MCL: Reconstruct both, ideally single-stage reconstruction is recommended.\n\nInjuries involving the PCL and medial collateral ligament often result from direct anterior trauma to the proximal tibia with valgus force, such as dashboard injuries in vehicular accidents or sports tackles. These lesions cause posterior tibial translation associated with valgus instability, especially near full extension. When untreated, they lead to chronic instability and medial joint overload.\n\nAlthough isolated MCL injuries are often treated nonoperatively, grade III tears associated with PCL ruptures generally require surgical reconstruction to restore both sagittal and coronal stability.\n\nIn low-resource settings, optimal graft choices should prioritize availability, biomechanical sufficiency, and ease of harvest:\n\nPCL: Hamstring or RF tendon or peroneus longus\n\nMCL: Femoral tunnel at isometric point (posterior and proximal to medial epicondyle). Canuto 56 : Or two tibial tunnels with sutured graft ends. 57\n\nPCL: Independent femoral and tibial tunnels\n\nTibial tunnel drilled using the anteromedial approach with posterior protection\n\nFemoral socket angled anteroproximally to avoid overlap with the MCL tunnel\n\nMCL: Canuto technique 56 : One femoral tunnel at isometric point (posterior and proximal to medial epicondyle). Two tibial tunnels, anterior and posterior to pes anserinus. Franciozi technique 57 : One tibial sling tunnel, single femoral tunnel + limb fixed posteriorly for POL.\n\nFixation Options/Low-cost fixation strategies:\n\nPCL: Metallic screw in femur; agrafe or suture loop in tibia\n\nMCL: Bone bridge or cortical tie-over at tibia\n\nFemoral press-fit or screw\n\nSuture anchors or staples (if available) at tibial side for sling/POL.\n\nSurgical Strategy\n\nIn isolated ACL + MCL lesions:\n\nGrade I–II MCL: Treat nonoperatively, reconstruct only PCL if necessary\n\nGrade I–II PCL: Treat nonoperatively, reconstruct only MCL if necessary\n\nGrade III MCL and PCL: Reconstruct both, ideally single-stage reconstruction is recommended.\n\nThis combination involves anterior and posterolateral instability, often resulting from high-energy trauma or overlooked posterolateral injury during ACL reconstruction. Isolated ACL reconstruction in the presence of unrecognized PLC injury frequently results in persistent instability, graft elongation, and ultimate failure. Correcting both structures—especially in a coordinated, anatomically accurate, and low-cost fashion—is essential.\n\nHamstring tendons: For either ACL or PLC\n\nHemiperoneal tendon: Suitable for PFL or popliteus components of PLC\n\nBPTB: When available, ideal for ACL with press-fit bone-to-bone fixation\n\nRF tendon autograft: Robust and long, ideal for ACL or PLC reconstruction using loop or sling techniques.\n\nACL: Tibial and femoral tunnels as per standard techniques. Or shared femoral tunnel with PLC possible, as described by Melo et al. 58\n\nPLC: Popliteus implant passed through the same femoral tunnel as the ACL. Fibular tunnel used for popliteofibular ligament (PFL) limb. Avoid tibial PLC tunnels in low-resource environments to minimize risk and cost.\n\nFixation Methods—Implantless/Low-cost Options.\n\nFemoral socket:\n\nPress-fit fixation for both ACL and popliteus graft limbs (ideal for BPTB).\n\nTibial/Fibular side:\n\nBone bridge or periosteal suture for PFL graft\n\nStaples (agrafe) or reused trauma washers for securing grafts.\n\nShared Femoral Tunnel Technique—Melo et al. 58\n\nDescribes a revision ACL + PLC reconstruction using a single femoral tunnel for both structures.\n\nGrafts diverge from the femur toward the tibial and fibular fixation points.\n\nIdeal for low-resource or revision settings where femoral bone stock is limited.\n\nCompatible with RF, semitendinosus, or BPTB grafts.\n\nFixation options include press-fit, screws, or low-cost staples.\n\nAnatomic PLC Reconstruction with Autografts—Franciozi et al. 54\n\nUses three autografts (gracilis, semitendinosus, and biceps femoris) for LCL, popliteus, and PFL.\n\nRequires independent tunnels; may be adapted to shared or simplified constructs.\n\nModified LaPrade Technique—Single-graft Loop 59\n\nA single long graft passed through fibular tunnel and fixed into femoral sockets for LCL and popliteus.\n\nReduces graft harvest and allows staged addition of PCL or ALL if needed.\n\nIn scenarios with predictable odds ratio access and stable soft tissues, single-stage reconstruction is preferred. However, in acute trauma or when tissue status is poor: Stage 1: ACL with bracing treatment Stage 2 (2 to 6 weeks): PLC reconstruction, using shared tunnel if feasible.\n\nStage 1: ACL with bracing treatment\n\nStage 2 (2 to 6 weeks): PLC reconstruction, using shared tunnel if feasible.\n\nSimultaneous injuries of the medial and LCLs (MCL + LCL) without cruciate involvement are rare but biomechanically significant, often resulting from direct varus-valgus forces applied in full extension. These injuries may present with gross coronal plane instability and often require surgical repair or reconstruction, especially when grade III.\n\nIn low-resource settings, autografts are prioritized for cost-effectiveness and availability:\n\nMCL: Preferred: Semitendinosus tendon using the Canuto technique 56 (femoral + two tibial tunnels). Alternative: Franciozi 57 triangular sling technique for additional posteromedial reinforcement.\n\nLCL: Preferred: Peroneus longus. Alternative: Fascia lata (when lateral tissue is compromised) or biceps femoris slip.\n\nMCL: Femoral isometric tunnel + two tibial tunnels anterior and posterior to the pes anserinus or single tibial sling tunnel\n\nLCL: Independent femoral tunnel and fibular tunnel.\n\nTunnel spacing must be carefully planned to avoid convergence on the femoral condyle and allow strong, isometric fixation.\n\nImplantless: Bone bridge, press-fit, and periosteal suture fixation.\n\nScrews (metallic and reusable)\n\nSurgical staples\n\nSuspensory loops for LCL femoral tunnel, if available.\n\nIn isolated MCL + LCL injuries, single-stage reconstruction is feasible and encouraged.\n\nGrade I–II MCL: Treat nonoperatively, reconstruct only LCL if necessary\n\nGrade III MCL: Reconstruct both, ideally single-stage reconstruction is recommended.\n\nComplete dislocation involving rupture of all four primary ligaments (ACL, PCL, MCL, and LCL) represents the most severe form of MLKI. These injuries are commonly due to high-energy trauma, often with neurovascular compromise, and require carefully staged, resource-optimized reconstruction to preserve joint function and limb viability.\n\nGiven the extent of reconstruction, careful planning of graft allocation is essential:\n\nACL: BPTB, hamstrings, or RF\n\nPCL: Peroneus longus, RF, or hamstrings (tripled if necessary)\n\nMCL: Semitendinosus using Canuto technique or Franciozi sling\n\nLCL: Peroneus longus or biceps femoris slip.\n\nIn many cases, bilateral graft harvest (contralateral hamstrings or rectus) may be necessary due to autograft limitations on the injured side.\n\nUse staggered femoral tunnels to avoid convergence\n\nShare tunnels when possible (eg, ACL + LCL through extended trajectory)\n\nPrioritize ACL/PCL central axis first, then reconstruct collateral ligaments.\n\nImplantless: Press-fit femoral/tibial fixation, cortical suture loops, and bone bridges.\n\nImplant options (as available):\n\nInterference screws\n\nSurgical staples\n\nSuspensory devices or reused trauma implants.\n\nSurgical Strategy: Staged Modular Approach (Schenck & Richter) 7 , 9\n\nStage 1:\n\nJoint reduction, external fixation if grossly unstable\n\nVascular repair (if needed)\n\nInitial central axis reconstruction (PCL and/or ACL).\n\nStage 2 (3 to 6 weeks):\n\nMCL and LCL reconstruction, once soft tissue envelope stabilizes\n\nUse remaining autografts or fascia lata if needed.\n\nIn single-stage cases (stable skin/soft tissues, odds ratio access available), all structures may be addressed together using modular tunnel strategy.\n\n\n## Anterior Cruciate Ligament + Posterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries\nGraft choices: Ipsilateral hamstring tendons (semitendinosus and gracilis) are commonly used due to availability and minimal donor site morbidity. The peroneus longus tendon and RF are a viable alternative, especially when larger grafts or longer constructs are needed. BPTB is an option that should always be considered for ACL reconstruction. 43\n\nTunnel configuration: Single-bundle reconstructions for both ACL and PCL are recommended in low-resource settings. A shared femoral tunnel, known as the “confluent tunnel” approach, reduces surgical time, avoids tunnel convergence, and minimizes implant requirements. 2 , 44\n\nImplantless techniques: Press-fit femoral fixation and tibial bone bridges can be used when implants are unavailable. These techniques use graft compression against cancellous bone or cortical ridges for mechanical stability. 45 - 47\n\nLow-cost implant techniques: When basic implants are available, the use of a metallic interference screw on the femoral side and a surgical staple (agrafe) on the tibial cortex offers an effective, reproducible, and affordable alternative. 48 , 49\n\n\n## Fixation Options\nImplantless techniques: Press-fit femoral fixation and tibial bone bridges can be used when implants are unavailable.

Three clinically feasible configurations include\n\nOption 1: Semitendinosus and gracilis tendons (hamstring) or BPTB for ACL, hemiperoneus longus tendon graft for ALL, and RF tendon for PCL reconstruction. 50\n\nOption 2: RF used as a double graft for both ACL and ALL (when of adequate length >24 cm), hamstring tendons for PCL. 37\n\nOption 3: Tripled hamstring graft (semitendinosus + gracilis) in braid configuration for ACL, 51 gracilis for ALL, and RF for PCL.\n\nOption 4: Semitendinosus and gracilis tendons (hamstring) for ACL, lemaire tenodesis for ALL, and RF tendon for PCL reconstruction. 52\n\nA single femoral tunnel for both ACL and ALL can be used, with the graft limbs diverging toward the tibial ACL and ALL insertion sites. This minimizes tunnel convergence and reduces surgical complexity. PCL femoral and tibial tunnels remain independent but can follow simplified trajectories.\n\nImplantless: Bone bridge on the tibial side (ACL), press-fit on the femoral side, and ALL may be sutured directly to periosteum.\n\nA metallic interference screw on the femoral ACL/PCL tunnel, staple (agrafe) for tibial ACL or ALL insertions, suspensory cortical button if available for ACL and ALL on femoral fixation, and BPTB press-fit fixation can be recommended as a fixation technique for ACL reconstruction.\n\n\n## Tunnel Configuration\nA single femoral tunnel for both ACL and ALL can be used, with the graft limbs diverging toward the tibial ACL and ALL insertion sites.

To reduce tunnel crowding, position ACL tunnel more anteriorly.\n\nPress-fit graft ends into femoral sockets\n\nBone bridge tibial anchoring or suture tying over cortical buttons (metal or reused implants)\n\nInterference screws (metallic, nonbiodegradable) in femur and tibia\n\nStaples (agrafes) for LCL or PCL tibial fixation\n\nSuspensory buttons or washers repurposed from trauma sets if available\n\nBPTB press-fit fixation can be recommended as a fixation technique for ACL reconstruction.\n\nA simplified version of the LaPrade anatomic posterolateral corner (PLC) reconstruction can be adapted using a single long autograft passed through the fibular head and fixed in separate femoral tunnels for the LCL and popliteus. 53 This avoids conflict with the ACL tunnel and reduces surgical steps.

The ACL can be reconstructed in a standard outside-in fashion and fixed with press-fit, screw, or suture-loop technique depending on graft and resources.\n\nTiming: In settings with limited access to ORs, single-stage reconstruction is recommended.\n\n\n## Anterior Cruciate Ligament + Posterior Cruciate Ligament + Posterolateral Corner Injuries\nThis combination is one of the most severe patterns of knee dislocation, resulting in global instability with anterior, posterior, and posterolateral laxity. Management requires coordinated reconstruction of the central axis (ACL and PCL) and the PLC, which, if unaddressed, leads to high failure rates of cruciate reconstructions. Although closely related within the lateral knee anatomy, injuries to the PLC and the LCL are not the same. The LCL is one of the key static stabilizers of the lateral compartment, resisting varus stress. By contrast, the PLC is a broader anatomic complex that includes the LCL, popliteus tendon, and popliteofibular ligament, among other structures. Although an isolated LCL injury results in linear varus instability, a true PLC injury causes combined varus and external rotational instability. Failure to identify and treat a complete PLC injury—beyond just the LCL—can lead to reconstruction failure of both ACL and PCL.\n\nPreferred Graft Choices in Low-resource Settings\n\nHamstring tendons for ACL or PLC, QT, or RF tendon autograft: Preferred for either ACL or PCL due to its robustness, length, and preservation of hamstrings.\n\nHemiperoneal autograft: (Split peroneus longus) ideal for popliteus or PFL components of PLC.\n\nBPTB: When feasible, especially for ACL, allows press-fit fixation without implants.\n\nBiceps femoris tendon (split): Can be used for LCL reconstruction, but may cause lateral instability or morbidity in already damaged PLCs.\n\nPlantaris tendon: Suitable for short graft needs (e.g., PFL), but variable in anatomy and diameter.\n\nACL and PCL: Independent tunnels for tibial and femoral fixation. Careful angulation to avoid tunnel convergence with PLC.\n\nFemoral tunnel shared for LCL and popliteus\n\nFibular tunnel for PFL\n\nAvoid tibial PLC tunnels in low-resource environments.\n\nFixation methods—Implantless/low-cost:\n\nPress-fit fixation in femoral and tibial sockets with BPTB\n\nBone bridges on tibia or fibula\n\nSutures over cortical bone for PFL or LCL anchoring.\n\nInterference screws (nonbiodegradable) for femoral ACL/PCL tunnels\n\nSurgical staples (agrafes) for securing tendons at tibial/fibular ends\n\nReused trauma implant (e.g., washers and buttons).\n\nAnatomic PLC Reconstruction with Autografts—Franciozi et al. 54\n\nDescribes the use of three autografts (gracilis, semitendinosus, and biceps femoris) to reconstruct LCL, popliteus, and PFL in their respective tunnels. Adaptable with\n\nPress-fit or metallic screw fixation\n\nCompatible with RF or hemiperoneal substitutions\n\nStep-by-step guidance for tunnel creation and graft passage.\n\nModified LaPrade Technique—Single-graft Loop\n\nUsing a long autograft passed through the fibular tunnel and fixed into two femoral sockets for LCL and popliteus.

While uncommon, it may result from high-energy varus-valgus stress combined with ACL rupture (e.g., motorcycle trauma and sports with twisting impacts). Simultaneous reconstruction of both medial and lateral complexes is technically demanding and must be carefully planned to avoid tunnel convergence and soft-tissue crowding.\n\nACL: Hamstring or BPTB or RF tendon\n\nLCL: Peroneus longus tendon\n\nMCL: Semitendinosus tendon with tibial tunnel, as described by Canuto et al. 56\n\nAlternative: Tibial sling with triangular configuration, including a posterior oblique ligament (POL) limb 57\n\nOthers: Fascia lata, QT (when hamstrings are preserved).\n\nACL: Independent femoral and tibial tunnels\n\nLCL: Femoral and fibular tunnels (PLC must be ruled out before considering isolated LCL)\n\nMCL: Canuto technique: Femoral tunnel + two tibial tunnels (anterior and posterior to pes anserinus).

MCL injuries are often managed nonoperatively; however, high-grade tears (grade III), or persistent instability after ACL reconstruction, require surgical treatment.\n\nACL: Hamstring or BPTB or RF tendon\n\nMCL: Semitendinosus tendon with tibial tunnel, as described by Canuto et al. 56\n\nAlternative: Tibial sling with triangular configuration 57\n\nOthers: Fascia lata, QT (when hamstrings are preserved), and peroneus longus tendon.\n\nACL: Independent femoral and tibial tunnels\n\nMCL: Femoral tunnel at isometric point (posterior and proximal to medial epicondyle).

These lesions cause posterior tibial translation associated with valgus instability, especially near full extension. When untreated, they lead to chronic instability and medial joint overload.\n\nAlthough isolated MCL injuries are often treated nonoperatively, grade III tears associated with PCL ruptures generally require surgical reconstruction to restore both sagittal and coronal stability.\n\nIn low-resource settings, optimal graft choices should prioritize availability, biomechanical sufficiency, and ease of harvest:\n\nPCL: Hamstring or RF tendon or peroneus longus\n\nMCL: Femoral tunnel at isometric point (posterior and proximal to medial epicondyle).

Isolated ACL reconstruction in the presence of unrecognized PLC injury frequently results in persistent instability, graft elongation, and ultimate failure. Correcting both structures—especially in a coordinated, anatomically accurate, and low-cost fashion—is essential.\n\nHamstring tendons: For either ACL or PLC\n\nHemiperoneal tendon: Suitable for PFL or popliteus components of PLC\n\nBPTB: When available, ideal for ACL with press-fit bone-to-bone fixation\n\nRF tendon autograft: Robust and long, ideal for ACL or PLC reconstruction using loop or sling techniques.\n\nACL: Tibial and femoral tunnels as per standard techniques.

These injuries are commonly due to high-energy trauma, often with neurovascular compromise, and require carefully staged, resource-optimized reconstruction to preserve joint function and limb viability.\n\nGiven the extent of reconstruction, careful planning of graft allocation is essential:\n\nACL: BPTB, hamstrings, or RF\n\nPCL: Peroneus longus, RF, or hamstrings (tripled if necessary)\n\nMCL: Semitendinosus using Canuto technique or Franciozi sling\n\nLCL: Peroneus longus or biceps femoris slip.\n\nIn many cases, bilateral graft harvest (contralateral hamstrings or rectus) may be necessary due to autograft limitations on the injured side.\n\nUse staggered femoral tunnels to avoid convergence\n\nShare tunnels when possible (eg, ACL + LCL through extended trajectory)\n\nPrioritize ACL/PCL central axis first, then reconstruct collateral ligaments.\n\nImplantless: Press-fit femoral/tibial fixation, cortical suture loops, and bone bridges.\n\nImplant options (as available):\n\nInterference screws\n\nSurgical staples\n\nSuspensory devices or reused trauma implants.\n\nSurgical Strategy: Staged Modular Approach (Schenck & Richter) 7 , 9\n\nStage 1:\n\nJoint reduction, external fixation if grossly unstable\n\nVascular repair (if needed)\n\nInitial central axis reconstruction (PCL and/or ACL).\n\nStage 2 (3 to 6 weeks):\n\nMCL and LCL reconstruction, once soft tissue envelope stabilizes\n\nUse remaining autografts or fascia lata if needed.\n\nIn single-stage cases (stable skin/soft tissues, odds ratio access available), all structures may be addressed together using modular tunnel strategy.\n\n\n## Graft Strategy\nGiven the extent of reconstruction, careful planning of graft allocation is essential:\n\nACL: BPTB, hamstrings, or RF\n\nPCL: Peroneus longus, RF, or hamstrings (tripled if necessary)\n\nMCL: Semitendinosus using Canuto technique or Franciozi sling\n\nLCL: Peroneus longus or biceps femoris slip.\n\nIn many cases, bilateral graft harvest (contralateral hamstrings or rectus) may be necessary due to autograft limitations on the injured side.\n\n\n## Tunnel Strategy\nUse staggered femoral tunnels to avoid convergence\n\nShare tunnels when possible (eg, ACL + LCL through extended trajectory)\n\nPrioritize ACL/PCL central axis first, then reconstruct collateral ligaments.\n\n\n## Fixation Method\nImplantless: Press-fit femoral/tibial fixation, cortical suture loops, and bone bridges.\n\nImplant options (as available):\n\nInterference screws\n\nSurgical staples\n\nSuspensory devices or reused trauma implants.\n\nSurgical Strategy: Staged Modular Approach (Schenck & Richter) 7 , 9\n\nStage 1:\n\nJoint reduction, external fixation if grossly unstable\n\nVascular repair (if needed)\n\nInitial central axis reconstruction (PCL and/or ACL).\n\nStage 2 (3 to 6 weeks):\n\nMCL and LCL reconstruction, once soft tissue envelope stabilizes\n\nUse remaining autografts or fascia lata if needed.\n\nIn single-stage cases (stable skin/soft tissues, odds ratio access available), all structures may be addressed together using modular tunnel strategy.\n\n\n## Rehabilitation and Follow-up in Vulnerable Populations\nRehabilitation is a critical determinant of functional outcome after MLKI, yet it remains a major challenge in low-income settings. Limited access to formal physical therapy, geographic barriers, and socioeconomic constraints frequently compromise adherence to structured postoperative protocols. 5\n\nIn resource-constrained environments, rehabilitation protocols must be both effective and feasible. Key principles include early mobilization to prevent stiffness, protection of reconstructed structures, and progressive strengthening. 60"
